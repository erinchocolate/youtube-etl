vincent06,"Some comments for those who want to do this tutorial in C#:
* 0:47:08 Call GD.Print() instead of print()
* 1:11:18 Delta is a double and it causes some difficulties working with other variables. The only solution I found is to systematically cast delta to a float.
* 2:15:24 Signals can (should ?) be handled with C# events. Custom signals are declared using the delegate syntax and must have the attribute [Signal]. Call EmitSignal() method instead of emit(). From my experience, doing this is easier than using the editor.
* 6:27:40 Use a property instead of a variable otherwise the tween won't be able to find the property: speed { get; set; }
* 6:35:13  I think casting the body variable to the Drone type with 'as' syntax would be more idiomatic. However you can do the same as in the video by calling HasMethod(""Hit"") and Call(""Hit"")
* 8:13:07 The autoloaded nodes are located under root so you can access the ""Globals"" node like this : GetNode<Globals>(""/root/Globals""). However I'm not sure this is very useful since we can use static variables in C#.",2023-08-15T14:52:26Z

Lenon Kitchens,"For posterity, around the 6 hour 6 minute mark when you're adding all the extra tracks to toggle the visible property of the light, I found it a lot easier to just make the light a child of the grenade sprite, thus inheriting it's visible property.

At 6 hours and 36 minutes, since I'm using C#, I had to come up with another way.  I simply checked if (body is CollisionObject2D) then if (body.GetCollisionLayerValue(2), which is the enemy layer, then cast body to a Drone and call Hit().  If I had multiple enemy types, I'd write a class called Enemy extending CharacterBody2D and implementing Hit(), then have all my baddies extend Enemy.  Then instead of casting to a Drone, I'd cast to an Enemy and call Hit();",2023-07-27T01:51:10Z

Taun Hawk,"Wonderful tutorial! Thanks for sharing. I really enjoyed your Udemy course ""Learn Python by making games"". One small minor critique on this new tutorial, most of the time you give a nice good one breath pause over each scene as you describe it, but sometimes, not always, sometimes, you will switch to a new scene say something about it or even make a small change and quickly move to another scene without giving enough time for us to see and digest the moment. Of course we can simply rewind and pause, but sometimes this is done so quickly that even that takes a bit of tinkering to find a good pause point. But this is not a complaint, absolutely love the content that you share!",2023-07-26T05:45:17Z
AgentCucco (Alt),"I got a few tips for people reading this, that I figured while messing around when I was watching, but before that.

I really wanna appreciate how you're not patronizing and instead assume people here already know the basics of code and logic, unlike most tutorials out there that treat viewers like 3 year olds, lol. Also just appreciating having an actual guide that isn't ashamed of telling people ""hey, you wanna learn how to use this engine? Be ready to spend a whole week following along this 15 hour *introduction* "", unlike most introductions that only spend 15 minutes glossing over concepts and expecting you to be ready after that. Just huge shoutouts overall for this guide, a lot of time and effort went into it and it clearly shows. I went from being intimidated and not knowing how to do *anything* in the engine to being pretty confident in starting my first game out of many.

Anyway, here are the tips for the people who clicked show more :P

1.- Holding alt/shift/ctrl before and after holding a node, can help a lot with changing values on the fly. For example, ctrl allows you to rotate in 15° intervals, holding alt allows you to drag the node you're selecting in the tree without touching it in the scene (amazing if you find locking nodes constantly to be annoying), and shift, doesn't do much on its own, but is really powerful when combined with other hotkeys. Try messing around with combinations of these before and after grabbing a node, you'd be surprised at how much functionality there is.

2.- The keys 1-5 allow you to zoom in from 100-1500% in the editor, while shift+1-5 allow you to zoom out from 50-3.13%. This is also really handy if you're someone like me who has a busted scroll wheel that only works when it wants to, lol, but also because I couldn't find a way to boost the zoom speed. Bear in mind the zoom applies to the last position you interacted with.

3.- Holding space allows you to move around the scene without having to use scroll bars or the middle mouse button (which I clarify is busted on my end, lol).

4.- Right click can also be really powerful, it was barely ever used in this guide, but I recommend everyone to mess around and right click everything they see to find really useful functions. One of the more convenient ones I found was adding keyframes in the AnimationPlayer.

5.- Export variables are inherited through inherited scenes. While this was rather obvious to figure out, it was not shown in the guide. I personally used it to streamline the crate and toilet, by making the total_drops an export variable that I added in item_container, so I could just change that value in the inspector for both the crate and toilet.

6.- While this isn't necessary, it can help to clean up your code. This video mentioned that snake_case was the default convention for Godot, and while this is true, if you mess around, you'll find out this varies quite a bit. By messing with CharacterBody templates, I found that the default convention for constants, is SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, which is not a surprise if you've worked with other languages in the past, but it wasn't mentioned in the guide. You'll also notice that signals and default functions have an underscore before them (i.e. _ready or _on_body_entered). If you stick to these conventions for your custom connected signals (like the ones in the level script), you'll make your code a lot cleaner, though maybe keep regular functions without the underscore at the start.

7.- This one's a bit more advanced, but it can help you make your code a LOT cleaner, and is unlikely to be covered in the missing 3 hours. Early returns are really useful. If you don't know what an early return is, it means to call the 'return' operation before the end of the function. Say for example you have a really nested function like _process in the grenade script, instead of checking:

if exploding:
    rest_of_code

you can check:

if not exploding:
    return
rest_of_code

You can probably see why this can be really powerful for making your code cleaner, as it reduces the amount of nests in your code. A rule of thumb is, if your code is getting out of the window, you probably have too many nests going on. It might be a bit counter intuitive to read at first glance, but being able to read all your code without having to scroll or look to the right, makes it a lot easier to parse when you're working with it. *Just make sure to return the value the function expects (void is usually the default one)*. This form of writing can also be used with the 'pass' operation when you're working with loops, for example.

8.- On a similar vein as last one, another good habit for readability is separating ands/ors into different lines. By default in python this will give you an error, but you can fix it by just using a parenthesis.

if long_name_condition1 and long_name_condition1 and long_name_condition1:

to

if (long_name_condition1
and long_name_condition2
and long_name_condition3):

You can probably immediately tell why this is a lot easier to read, specially with long conditions that go super off-screen. This might get a little bit weird to write if you have more complex, separate conditions (and/or interchangeably, and using parentheses to separate them), but for repeating conditions like you see in the example with 2 ands, it's really simple.

9.- Take all of these with a grain of salt! I have years of experience with LUA but I'm new to python/gdscript, so someone might come here and explain why some of my points are dumb or overkill. They are just advice that has worked for me personally and hope it might help other people, they are not hard rules set in stone that you must follow :P",2023-07-26T03:03:06Z

I did run into one issue with the UI transitions and the Animation Player at 8:42:40 and I would love to know if you have any more insight on this: When trying this originally, setting the color to black made the solid black screen appear on running and I couldn't get it to work as I saw it in the tutorial

After messing around, I found that adjusting the color to black while the animation player for fade_to_black was on the final frame (1 on the counter) forced the black screen to stay up. If I adjusted the color to black while the animation was on frame 0, the behavior was as shown in the video. I found the same thing with the reveal animation

Do you think this is a bug? Or is this sort of Animation Player behavior something you've experienced as normal within Godot?",2023-07-21T04:00:58Z

can of soda,"i only have one problem so far and its at about 4:22:00, where the tilemap for the house is set up. If I allow Godot to automatically create tiles, then the tiles will be 16 pixels and too small to work with. If I set it up myself (with a size of 390 pixels), then the ""Cell Quadrant Size"" in the inspector will be too small (I cannot set it to anything below 128) and I will have to place each tile with pinpoint accuracy so that it aligns with its neighbors. I'm not sure if this will be important later and don't feel like finding out 3 hours into the future so I was wondering if anyone had a solution to this

I wanted to ask though about the pattern of putting variables in a global scene. How widespread is this practice and is it a good idea to get used to it? Being familiar with OOP, it's common to hear people say that you should limit access to your variables as much as possible. Wouldn't it be a better idea to place the player stats inside the player script and share them from there, even if it could be more inconvenient? Was the global script done only for the purposes of the tutorial perhaps? Thank you in advance for your time if you can answer. Keep up the good work!",2023-07-15T13:11:17Z
Hivk,"Man I can barely make my own video last 2 minutes my god.
I'm 6 minutes in and this already looks like an amazing tutorial.
The fact that this is free is amazing!

(I'll update this comment based on how far I've gotten)


23 Minutes in, everything feels really clear, and I never feel like I have to catch up. Gonna take a break here. I also have an issue where I can't drag files into the FileSystem. (Problem solved, I can just open the folder in file explorer)

1h in and everything is at such a nice pace. I don't ever feel pressured, yet I feel so much more in control over the software now. I feel like this tutorial has a lot of potential! Also finally a good explanation of Nodes. Crazy how such a weird concept is finally so easy to comprehend.

1h 22m in, not much more. Was already familiar with DeltaTime, but this just reassured all my thoughts. Nice to see basically every concept being went through, and I'm not even a 10th of the way through. It's now 23 : 00 (11PM) so I'm gonna return to this tomorrow.

2h 10m in. Coming from a Scratch user (yes ... you can actually make proper games in that, you can check out Griffpatch if you want) I'm much more used to writing my own functions for physics and stuff, but these explanations make me feel more confident in these inbuilt one. Especially about ""move_and_slide"" with the ""velocity"" variable.

2h 38m: Timer and signals, this is something I think I was looking for. Absolutely crucial concepts and very nice to know. I will say the ""$Timer.start()"" function wasn't really made clear before the exercise, but after I viewed the solution, everything makes sense :)

3h 20m: Clones huh. This is not at all like Scratch's clones work ... so I'm just slightly confu-.

Hi I Am Barney,"So I'm almost through now (after a devastating bug that was caused by the Spawn Positions children inside the Crate and Toilet, where I had accidentally named the parents Node2D ""SoawnPositions"". After renaming it properly in the parent, Godot crashed everytime when a Scene was loaded with one Crate or Toilet in it. I had to manually edit the TSCN file to not include these children anymore and re add them, which took a bit of fiddling. Scary stuff, none the less).

I've had several run ins with unruly area body calculations, where my lasers in particular would simply sometimes disappear. I've learned that when checking collision boxes and masks, if I use the vertical ... symbol (which is a lot clearer as to what is selected anyways) for checking these, I get no issues. Depending on the current sauce on the spaghetti, that is Godot sometimes, this is something to watch out for!

One thing I notice is that (especially for the enemies) we store the Player position in a ""Global Variable"". I think this is very unnecessary busywork and clutters up the code in the long run, at least if you want to access multiple things from the Player.
I am not quite aware of Performance impact comparatively to the method shown but it's a lot easier to just add the Player CharacterBody2D to a Group called ""Player"" and in the enemy script, for example you want the Player Position, go like: pos = get_tree().get_first_node_in_group(""Player"").global_position
And that's it, really.",2023-07-14T12:04:22Z

```gd
extends Object
class_name MyClass

var attribute_1: int

func _init(attribute_1: int):
----self.attribute_1 = attribute_1

then you can create it wherever using
```gd

Frank Drebin,"11:22:27 some explanation of that performance penalty: GPU runs multiple threads in parallel (32 for CUDA) on a single processing unit, and these threads are following the same instructions, but with their own memory (own variables). If one thread diverges due to ""if"" statement, the other threads have to wait until it finishes ""if"" block. In many cases conditions are perfectly fine, all depends if condition result will be the same between multiple threads at that point in time.
Also problem with ""current_a == 1.0"" is that floats are an approximation, and almost in all cases you need inequality operator e.g. ""current_a >= 0.9999"". Godot manual have some more info about floats in shading language section.",2023-07-13T17:43:16Z

Zemeio,"Some more advices I think could be useful here (disclaimer: I'm only 2 hours into the video and downloaded the final version to check it out)

1. In your game, if you have a bigger screen you can see more, which can be unfair. It's easy to fix this by doing these steps (which will make your game scale if you increase the window size)
    1. Project -> Project Settings
    2. Turn on Advanced Settings (button on the top right)
    3. Go to Display -> Window
    4. Set the Stretch Mode to ""canvas_items""
2. The things that mess with physics (moving, colliding etc) should be done inside the _physics_process, not _process. For this game it won't change that much, but it can generate some inconsistent physics for some more complex games. Things like timers, which depend on real time instead of physics frames, are usually better at _process.

I will keep updating here with advice I can find, or if someone wants to reply with their own =).",2023-07-11T20:12:38Z

And as variants we could make some interesting graphical editor based on Pygame, for example 2d map editor or graph editor so we could move graph nodes with mouse (Drag'n'Drop function), implement some game components (for example light, particle system, triggers, time of day changer, camera). 😁😉",2023-07-05T14:53:37Z
Geeves,"I thought this was an hour and not 11 hours.. amazing level of detail!!!

I actually came here because another course I am doing (my frist one for Godot) started off really easy but it's zipping through increasingly advanced material and I am not keeping up with the leraning, just typing what I see and absorbing some of it, sometimes.

I'm nearly 2 hours into this one and I feel like every, single step is explained in detail, which is what I need. THANK YOU!!!! 

I thought I was going to blitz a 1hr course since I've been (kind of) keeping up with another course already but I am learning something the whole way.

Also THANK YOU SO MUCH for providing the files at every stage!!! If I miss something, I am not punished for it, nor do I have to dig back through practically frame-by-frame to find what I missed that is preventing my progress in the future. 

Absolutley so thankful for this.",2023-07-05T12:40:17Z
Panagiotis kougioumtzidis,"Hi I want to congratulate you again for your excellent work.
I’ve start doing the ‘The ultimate introduction to Godot 4’ but when I insert GPUParticles2D and trying to select from 'Process Material' the 'New ParticleProcessMaterial' the program crashes and close.
When I insert GPUParticles2D it says:
drivers/vulkan/rendering_device_vulkan.cpp:7735 - Condition ""!pipeline"" is true.
This compute pipeline requires (0) bytes of push constant data, supplied: (32)
No compute pipeline was set before attempting to draw.

Is there something that I can do to fix this?
Thanks again.",2023-07-05T11:58:25Z

Wald Sin,"Thank you very much for your work. Your lessons have clarified so many points that I used to do on crutches, now I already have a basic set of knowledge that I feel is adequate for initial work on projects.

I would like to make a small remark about the account 10:41:00
It seemed to me that your decision was suboptimal to call the hit() function in _process().
I did it a little differently:
I added Area2D to Grenade and set Monitoring to false. This zone will be responsible for the affected area. After that, I added a call to the body_entered() handler
func _on_attack_area_body_entered(body):
    if body.has_method(""hit""):
        body.hit()
after that, I added a track to the Monitoring value in the AnimationPlayer, which first activates it at the moment of the explosion, and then turns it off after 0.1 seconds.
That's all I needed for the mechanism to start working and the explosion occurred only once for all objects in the area.

I also want to touch on the moment with custom signals. At many points, we need to connect signals manually - in the editor or with the help of code, and I think that this approach will complicate work with the code in the future.
I can't offer a better solution yet, but I'll go down the following path:
I will try to make each object as independent as possible. So that each scene is responsible for its own logic and, if necessary, calls parents or children, and checks for the presence of handlers.
If such a system can be developed, then ideally every scene will run in any environment with the same behavior and we will not have many references in the code to scenes that are not related to each other.
But this is not a decision, just an observation that I would like to organize better.

Maybe someone has additional thoughts on this? It would be interesting to know.

In any case, I am very grateful for your work. I hope that thanks to you, the Godot community will expand significantly and we will have many new and interesting projects based on this engine.
I'm going to watch the second part.
greetings from Ukraine.",2023-07-04T14:34:18Z

Archer Wayne,"Hi Clear Code, I am really appreciate the tutorials you make. I started code in pygame a year ago because your videos not only teach code but also explain the ideas behind it. This makes me truly understand programming in a desginning level and I made few games using pygame. 

Now I started using Godot because I wanted to create a more complex game and I feel python's proformance is not good enough. But I struggled to learn godot because most tutorials didnt explain things clearly as you did. 

Thanks for the programming videos you made over the years. Gaming programming now has became the most important passion to me and it was your videos that overcame difficulties on the way. Love!",2023-06-29T15:37:22Z
