Himanshu Sharma,"Great compilation. I would humbly add that we should also learn to train our brain to grasp real-life contexts. For instance, I wouldn't want to build a surface lexicon that pertains to the lingo of an organisation other than what I want to work for. There is a code (a set of specific and unique words) for every organisation/Domain and for every man-made context. We should strive to learn these codes to excel and prevail when put on a spot in frequently encountered situations such as phone calls or interviews. More importantly, speech and intonation play a greater role in the effective communication of embellishing words. 
Once again, Thank you. It's one of those videos which I have personally archived.",2023-08-17T12:30:55Z
Griffin519x,"One point I’d add is that silence isn’t always the replacement for “Umm”. Saying umm is a verbal indication that you’re thinking about the answer before you respond. Maybe replacing it with “That’s interesting, let me think about that”, or something similar to fit the context of the conversation, would make you sound more articulate but still let’s the listener know that you’re thinking about what they said/asked",2023-08-17T10:47:58Z

Matt S,I will say though I have a pet peeve for people who talk like this guy in the sense that they over-enunciate their words. Just makes it sound like they’re trying to hard instead of just talking naturally.,2023-08-15T23:38:18Z
Matt S,"I feel like my surface lexicon is probably 10s of thousands of words. I enjoy speaking eloquently and using verbiage that actually articulates what im trying to convey rather than defaulting to what most people do when they can’t think of the word like “sorta like” “kinda like” etc. 

But that’s probably just because I’ve always been reading I remember in 5th grade I was reading Executive Orders by Tom Clancy which is an enormous book and my age 50+ 5th grade teacher told me her husband was reading that same book at home lol.

Also I always watch tv and films with the subtitles on and I think this has a huge unconscious impact on building lexicon depth. You just start using words that you might’ve always known but never really employed and they will just come out natural.

Also any time I read or see a word I don’t know exactly what it means I look it up even if I’ve looked up the same word before.",2023-08-15T23:34:35Z

Domino Development,"Very interesting, and I also think important, video! I especially like the ideas regarding the pause, as well as the control and intention of it. In media I'd been used to observing people replying swiftly and talking rapidly. Some of these I regarded as competent people, conditioning me to communicate similarly to them. It's when I started digesting more auditive long-form philosophical and educational material that I realized the power of the pause; taking some extra time to think through both the content and delivery. 

Here are my thoughts of how I became, and still practice to become, more articulate. To preface; I think it mostly comes down to thinking, and writing is more formalized thinking, whereas speaking is more spontaneous thinking. Therefore, practicing thinking and writing also improves fundamental elements of speaking. 

I think that writing helps immensely in the pursuit of becoming more articulate. While this provides me with a bit of a safety net; to remember material I've written when I'm speaking, it mainly helps me practice more advanced articulations, since I have more time to think, and also research. Even this very comment will help me out when discussing articulating ones speech; I've now thought through what I've done to achieve a higher degree of language articulation, and I've now stored some documented notes of it in a database of my writing which I can go back and review. 

One thing that I do, as a bilinguist who thinks in two languages, is to practice translating words and expressions. I'm usually able to quickly express something in one of these languages, or at least when combining the two, but I want this translation to be as frictionless as possible. A translating tool can be useful for this purpose. I mostly do this when I'm thinking, but it also occurs when I'm writing. Aside from translating tools, when I'm writing I also have a dictionary from the respective language ready. In this way I can look up synonyms and antonyms for certain words; allowing me to choose a more rhythmic or impactful word for the text,  and to form connections between words so that I'm increasingly able to do the same when speaking.

Finally - and you touched on this in the video - putting yourself in situation where you're consuming and creating articulate material can be invaluable. Instead of a lot of mainstream music or content, digest that complicated podcast or lecture, or let your thoughts be the soundtrack. Enter the library, sit down in front of the typewriter, engage in social situations. I'm very blessed to now be in a position where I can constantly choose quality input and activities regarding developing one's ability to articulate language - and in turn articulate one's being. There are reasons for Newspeak in Orwell's 1984...",2023-08-15T08:22:52Z

Zoopdewhoop,"Pausing only works if you're addressing someone with the patience and interest to listen to you. Most people are half-assed listeners who switch off the second you introduce the slightest break to choose your words. Or worse, they think you're struggling mentally and try to finish your sentence for you. So it's not just what you say, it's also how invested your audience is in the conversation. Attention spans ain't what they used to be.",2023-08-14T02:42:11Z
Simon Linser,"I think sometimes people don't listen, they aren't interested or they don't care. So they miss the ways language is used. Obviously you have to listen to great speakers to become better. But if you read and listen and think instead of assuming you know what they said or meant or the nuances of when they say the same thing differently. Because learning is highly context dependent, we will also use cues to draw upon our vocabulary. So by being a good listener and thinking about what you hear or read, you'll be training your brain to automatically use context cues to select a pool of words related to that cue/ clue.",2023-08-14T02:30:49Z

Ajm Jabir,"The speaker in the YouTube video discusses five qualities that articulate speakers understand to enhance their speech:

>Expanding Surface Lexicon: Articulate speakers broaden their surface vocabulary by using words from their deep lexicon (less frequently used words) to convey ideas more vividly and expressively. This involves using words that might not be in their default vocabulary.

>Commanding the Pause: Effective use of pauses in speech allows speakers to create impact, emphasize key points, and give themselves time to organize their thoughts. Pausing showcases intentionality and confidence in speech.

>Pruning Filler Words: Articulate speakers consciously reduce filler words like ""um,"" ""ah,"" and ""like"" to make their speech more precise and deliberate. This requires mindful monitoring of speech patterns and habits.

>Language Inputs Inventory: Being mindful of the language sources one is exposed to, such as books, media, and conversations, helps in improving speech quality. Engaging with rich and articulate language sources enhances one's vocabulary and speaking skills.

>Tuning Vocal Instrument: A melodic and varied voice adds depth and impact to speech. By adjusting pitch, volume, speed, and variation, speakers can make their words more engaging and appealing, akin to music.

The video suggests that by practicing these five techniques, individuals can develop greater articulacy, leading to more expressive, persuasive, and engaging speech.",2023-08-13T12:08:02Z

I would throw up inside my mouth if someone said, ""I've reached idea poverty."" Just say, ""I'm all out of ideas."" Make your speaking more descriptive when you actually need to comunicate more descriptively. This guy for real said, ""How do we give the words we already know more buoyancy."" That is not the way you use the word buoyancy. He also was extremely uncomfortable when saying it and had to clearly think for a few seconds. He could've just said, ""how do we become familiar enough with the words in our deep lexicon to be able to use them sub-conciously."" Or something like that. Those are all surface lexicon words but they make you sound like a normal person who isn't pretentious.",2023-08-13T04:36:10Z

I never comment but I would add this : for each piece of deep lexicon you bring back to life - specialy the ones you find elegant - find usefull and funny use cases in your mind by subvocalizing. 
Also I think that in order to be able to use them at will, while doing the exercice above, you have to feel what this practice will bring you, specialy on the emotional level : there's no shame to be driven by pride and a controled sense of superiority while learning. 
The key is to be humble while using these words with people and, when you notice/feel your interlocutor won't understand, rephrase simply and succinctly your idea right after so they can feel like they are on the same deep thoughts boat as you are. I hope it can help!

Adeel M,"1. Using a word 38 unique times imprints and registers the word into our surface lexicon.

2. Pace yourself when speaking - in a way which mundane normal words are replaced by descriptive and articulate words.

3. Pausing. This allows for intimacy. Precision and suspense add another dimension.

4. Keep your mouth closed, and literally form your sentence. This prevents uhms and aahs and simple words and repetition.

5. Tap into the tapestries of speech of which mirorring them would enable eloquency.
I personally read classic arabic texts (translated to english) by imam Al Ghazali r.a, thereby rendering my writing and formal speech as such.

Sam Collins,"Great video!
As someone who is passionately trying to become more articulate, I can really appreciate your work!
What I found the most interesting was the idea that the size of people‘s lexicons are mostly the same, but what differentiates the articulate from the inarticulate is that they have imported words from their deep lexicon into their surface lexicon. I think that makes sense. When you listen to somebody like Peterson for the first time, you can be quite overwhelmed by his usage of some unusual words (like propensity, proclivity, …), but once you‘ve watched him for a while, you notice that he uses these words on regular basis which is why he can conjure them up so fast.
Another idea that struck me was to take a step back and look at your language input more critically and increase the amount of articulate speech into your daily routine. That made me think that I could start listening to particularly eloquent public speakers whenever I‘m on the bus or on the train. 

So thanks for the suggestions!",2023-08-11T22:37:08Z

Thomas Fisher,"I don't get what the hate is on filler words. Saying ""um"" is a way of signalling intention to speak. In environments such as interviews and public speaking events, there's already the social expectation that you're going to say something, but if out in the wild you just stay silent until you know what to say, people might misinterpret that silence. They might think you didn't hear them, or are ignoring them. So, filler words let them know you heard, and you're going to speak soon.",2023-08-11T22:20:14Z

Walter Kemp Bruce,"This is pretty constructive, but at risk of influencing people toward something much worse than verbosity: being a wanker. 

Honestly, if you're thinking ""wow, I sound so articulate,"" chances are, your interlocutor isn't in agreement. It's much more likely that they're subconsciously aware of your thought process. In other words, it's less ""wow, this person is so articulate,"" and more ""wow, this person thinks they're so articulate.""  Those are very, very different states. 

Typically, when I notice someone playing this game with their social performance, it signals a lack of intelligence and social awareness to me. The ability to express yourself clearly is more important than using rare and specific words, especially if the chances are that your listener won't understand them. It's also much less important than expressing good ideas, which is the only real context to be impressed by eloquence. 

I have a real tendency towards this kind of frilly speech. Growing up in a British context, surrounded by writers and semi-intellectual bourgeoisie, I was always told to clam it. ""You sound like a wanker."" It was the best advice I could've been given. Probably. 

I will say, to play devils advocate, that I've always loved Darren McGarvey's fluency as an orator. The combination of his thick Glasgow accent and the most articulate speech I've ever heard is quite compelling. I recommend him to anyone interested in examples of gifted self-expression. 

Anyway, I enjoyed writing that. 

Yeah, that was fun.

Are you still reading?

Wow. 

...Strange isn't it: the two of us, separated by time and space; sharing the internet... It totally violates the social cluster dynamics of the real world. I have no idea who you are. To me, you're just an empty category. A space to be filled. To you, I'm just the origin of a set of words, some of which form a kind of argument of interrelated claims and observations. Still, you know almost nothing about me. 

I wonder how accurately you'd guess what kind of person I am.",2023-08-10T20:43:38Z

Cesar Zambrano,"I think y'all forget that the point of articulating yourself is so that people can understand you. The best writers and communicators keep their language simple when there's no need for any extra detail. These unique words have unique situations it doesn't make sense to say something like ""I'm at idea poverty"" you're mentally masturbating in public when you say something like that. 

It's important to make yourself literate there is definitely value in that no doubt but that's the issue I see between classes is that there is a disconnect because they almost speak a completely different language or dialect because one side is always looking to simplify themselves and the other is making simple ideas more lucrative than what it actually is. It's always funny to see people misjudge a person because of something like this and see them outperform everyone else they held to a higher status because they never considered to polish their public persona. 

At the end of the day reality is reality. If it works then it fucking works. But there is no harm in growing your vocabulary and being more articulate in your speech. Just remember your words are just tools they won't fix everything you have to have the balls to get your hands dirty to make it happen which is a detail many folks with privilege struggle with. I could go on but my point is that your character will end up being the ultimate factor as to how you change things around you. A lot of us don't realize how important we are to the spider web we all live in because it seems like we don't really matter too much a lot of the time but you might very well matter quite a bit to someone else without realizing it causing an entire wave of chain reactions down the line.",2023-08-10T08:05:26Z

Connor Wilcox,"There’s some really good tips here and some really misleading ones. Sounding articulate doesn’t come from using a bunch of really obscure words whenever possible, it comes from using your surface lexicon as efficiently as possible. 

Slang is the definition of efficiency, packing a lot of meaning into a widely understood word to get your point across more quickly. The only issue that comes about with slang and vulgarity is when a word represents too many distinct ideas and there’s no way to differentiate which is being used based on the context surrounding the word (i.e. did you see that jawn yesterday?). As long as the context surrounding the word narrows it’s meaning down to something understandable by others, there’s no reason to avoid using it other than arbitrary social pressures.

Overall, I think the best mindset to have is not to try to sound a particular way for the sake of others’ perception of you, but to use your words effectively and efficiently to communicate your ideas clearly and not waste others’ time.",2023-08-09T23:21:56Z

ddevvnnull,"So, if I understood you correctly, to summarize:

1. Broadening one's surface lexicon/your go-to daily reserve of vocabulary.
2. Cultivating a deep(er) lexicon. The reserve that requires more attention and discernment compared to your surface lexicon.
3. Abstaining from filler words. They bog down a conversation and compromise the quality of your speech. Recursively refining your speech by saying words first without understanding the endpoint of your statement is one version of this problem.
4. Observing and improving your language inputs. What you read and listen to, including passively, has an influence on your own speech. Try to imbue your language inputs with refined literature, poetry, enhanced speech, and the like.
5. Don't underestimate the efficiency of your vocals. Your speed, pauses, volume, and other aspects of vocalized speech can leave an undeniable impression on others.

I also use most of these languages on a weekly basis, often many per day and I hardly ever pay attention to speaking ""properly"" - I just grab words that are sufficient to get my message across, worst of all, if I know my opposite knows any of the other languages, I just borrow from whatever language my brain produces the desired word the fastest.

Benjamin Lewis Blythsmith,"Hey Joseph, I am from the UK and I don’t mean to sound drastic but I have been LONGING to change the way I sound. I grew up in an area which majored in colloquial language and it is so hard to shake off. Everyone that meets me at work, or wherever I am, can instantly tell where I grew up and I hate it. The points you gave in this video gave me life. I am so excited to put these into action and see the improvement they will make in the next few months. And of course, I am subscribing straight away…

Thank you for this video. You are a true champion.",2023-08-08T08:40:22Z

Rodkata,"You've made great points in this video, especially the first one about the surface and deep level of lexicon. You seem to become yourself articulate, judging by the pauses, the use of words, facial expressions, combined with hand gestures. You have an astonishing potential and remarkable video editing skills, so I subscribe, because I believe that this channel will grow quickly, sooner or later, and you should keep going up!",2023-08-05T21:27:09Z
Vivienne Bowden,Joseph. Thank you very much for your talk on how to improve one's speech making.   Pronouncing is also very important I think.

keyli games video,"The most articulate person expands their surface lexicon by:
1-Repetition 
->give ur self to index ur vocabulary (is this the right word)
2-Use pauses(allows u to give u good formulation of the sentences)
3-pruning ur filler word 
—>processus the ending of ur word
—>keep ur mouth close until u think about it word 
4-expose ur self to a good source to feature ur lexique 
5-vocal and tone of ur words",2023-08-05T10:46:29Z
