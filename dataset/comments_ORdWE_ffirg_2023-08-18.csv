Liednard,"Pretty amazing at this point, with 100 stories of bankruptcy for 1 success, people still believe in this nonsense. Decentralized economy is an interesting concept but the entire execution is a laughable fail, ending up in an ultra-predatory trading market with fake, worthless tokens, to pit poor people to fight each others for scraps while dominated by the rich (e.g whales) who can easily sway these small markets their way. And then there's all the scamming and NFT bullshit.
And ppl keep going at it due to excessive exposition of winners, just like gambling.

Mrcl K,"You should do more actual research on Bitcoin and the difference between Bitcoin and all other crypto coins.. because it is obvious that you didn't. You create a nice to view documentary, but are obviously not an expert on the subject. That is what bitcoiners mean when they say 'you don't understand' and 'ngmi'.

At the beginning you just repeat all the heavily debunked arguments against Bitcoin like transaction throughput, energy usage and ponzi scheme bullshit.
Even if all the arguments against Bitcoin would be factually true, Bitcoin is still literally a live saver for lots of people in the world that live under heavy inflation and/or corrupt governments with Turkey, Nigeria and Argentina as current examples.

NFT's, Web3 and all other things that spouted from Bitcoin are just distracting from what Bitcoin is actually trying to achieve which is taking control of money out of the hands of governments and banks and give it back to the people.
Bitcoin is MONEY and a counter against fiat currency that keeps being debased by their issue-ers, but it has to go through different fases (respectively store of value, means of exchange and unit of account) before it actually reaches the unit of account fase. Every new technology went through different adoption fases and where heavily criticized before they reached their full potential. For example the car, the internet, tv, phones, even electricity was useless because we had horses, letters and candles so why do we need those diabolical new technologies?",2023-08-15T14:30:22Z

Thatfilmguy,"Sure there are scams, but to label all crypto a scam shows me that you are a sell out. This is a technology that can allow us the people to have power against a centralised system that will come in the form of cryptocurrencies anyways as CBDCs (Central backed digital currencies). This is programable tokens that the government will use to control people. There is far more then meets the eye. Don’t take this documentary for face value. This is far more complex then being portrayed here. Maybe James you don’t have a deeper understanding, maybe you don’t know about the technology and how it works in comparison to what we currently have with institutions. 

Do you even know what an NFT is? You are creating content on the naive narrative that most people will succumb to. Honestly. Shame on you. 

Yes there are scams out there promising the world… but this technology DOES and MUST be used in the way it was intended. Some of us buy Bitcoin for this reason and will NEVER ALLOW IT TO BR WORTHLESS.

captain awesome 2023,"the funniest thing about NFTs is that you don't actually own the art, you just own a link to a piece of art on the blockchain. People are so keen to get rich quick, or so ignorant about what the thing is they are buying, they don't even bother to find out or do any homework. There is a fantastic use case for Bitcoin and crypto that continues to this day. Criminals and scammers can use it to extract value from people in the course of conducting their crimes. Scammers ask for payments to bitcoin wallets, and so do extortionists, exactly because of its anonymous and decentralised nature. Crypto currency is the best mechanism for money laundering ever invented. They have moved heavily into gaming now, with insane amounts of money to develop games that are tied in some way to blockchain. These games end up being nothing but hype, do not meet even minimum users, and the original developers run away with millions in their pocket. Each time this happened, many consumers gets burned, and the reputation gets damaged. That's why they have to keep rebranding, but at some point, everyone in the world is going to get wise and associate 'blockchain' with fraud, criminality, and scams.",2023-08-14T10:48:14Z

Decentrify Tech,"Crypto IS NOT A SCAM! Its been RUINED by both naïve and scammer YouTubers and hundreds of millions of FINANCIALLY DESPERATE and financially naïve people taken advantage of by greedy and opportunistic exchange developers and ruined the purpose of crypto

Tell me - have any of you EVER READ SATOSHI NAKAMOTO'S WHITE PAPER ON CRYPTO?

NOPE.....

Do you even know the  what centralized and decentralization even are?

HARDLY....

Your content is good but you and the 99% masses still DO NOT UNDERSTAND CRYPTO - instead you badmouth crypto not understanding what it is  and the financially desperate masses screwed crypto up. 

Crypto WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE AN INVESTMENT OR AN ASSET CLASS!

The majority of people just do not understand that - and the desperate and naive masses cannot be fully blamed for your ignorance and dismissal of crypto because you are financially desperate and predatory exchange developers took advantage of you - as did celebrities like Tom Brady, Matt Damon and Kim Kardashian who told the uneducated masses 'go buy crypto.'

The majority of people still only understand money through centralized banking and the contemporary investing  paradigm and that is why crypto is bastardized. 

No one ever read Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper on crypto and understood the whole point of crypto - to end the control of money by central banks - and because the 99% of you messed it up, the govt and central banks are now adopting blockchain and crypto technology and will now FORCE it upon you to control and monitor you.

Mr. Rainbow Sprinkles,"I like a few cryptos and pretty much agree with almost everything you said. However this was more of a critique on the industry and the investors and how they use the technology rather than the technology itself like I was hoping it would be.

Maybe you mentioned it in your last video but there are definitely some scary coincidences with ALL of crypto that seems to point towards one thing so I’ve always been very skeptical of the tech simply because of that (it’s about enslavement).

Could you perhaps do another look into this in another year or two? I’ll give you a hint at where to start. The tech behind Bitcoin was created by a 3 letter group in the land of the free and apparently “copied/stolen” by Satoshi Nakamoto. Then the capabilities of the tech also aligns with the goals of a 3 letter group based out of Switzerland led by a German guy.

The very reason Bitcoin was said to be created for could actually be a lie and the truth may be the opposite of that advertised reason.",2023-08-11T09:31:39Z

Tracy Watts,"A lot of people are buying crypto NOT to get rich quick. But as a tool to maintain their value against fiat currency and inflation. That’s why after 12 years it’s still holding value. My $25,000 bank savings account took 6 months to earn thirteen cents. When I went to transfer funds the bank charged me $5 transfer fee. . They convinced me to move that money from chequing to savings to earn interest and it ended up costing me money . I felt duked. It’s a small amount but the principle of it that pissed me off. 

 The banking system is corrupt. My mutual fund took 10 years to make $4000 in what today is only $200 shy of one mortgage payment for me. Investment funds are not keeping up with inflation. Why is gold worth so much? There is no cap on gold because we can keep mining it. Yet it’s the faith of the people that give it value that is the same principle for Bitcoin but the difference Bitcoin is capped!
. You can’t move gold or store it in your wallet yet people still buy in. Gold goes up and down in value daily and at the end of the day the year a decade it is still WAY behind inflation. 
Wall Street caused the 2008 crash because it’s a big ponzi  scheme too. Why would anybody trust Wall Street again? Huge chunks of your money end up going into fees for service and returns are often just keeping up with true inflation. 

People are looking for a way to store their money that will keep up with the true cost of inflation not what the feds report as we know those numbers are bullshit. 

This is a decentralized currency that can not be manipulated by feds the banks or governments . This was a great tutorial but you are missing a lot of true facts. I would not bother with any other crypto other than Bitcoin it’s the gold of crypto. but like the gold standard the oldest commodity in the world that the dollar is no longer backed by since 1971. How is till holding value? Because the people say it has value. 
With double digit trillions of US deficits why is the US one of the richest countries in the world? Because they say the US dollar holds value and has a strong currency because they say so.",2023-08-02T19:25:25Z

Do you even know how much energy our current banking system needs? And on top of that, the currency is backed by guns, not with kinetic energy like bitcoin is. Bitcoin is and will always rise in value, because its NOT a scam, it is a true revolution of a ponzi fiat scheme. It is the best idea humans ever had since money exists. Bitcoin isnt about Nfts or scams like you describe. And also: Bitcoin isnt supposed to be scalable, because in that way it can really be a secure network. The scalabality can be solved by layer2 solutions like the lightning network. And no, ethereum isnt revolutionary.

Unfortunately for me, I invested 80,000
GBP worth of bitcoin with a fraudulent company. I was happy to watch my account grow to 280,000 GBP within a couple of weeks. But i didn't realize i was dealing with a scam company, until i tried to make an attempt to withdraw. I made a withdrawal request, and noticed my account was suddenly blocked for no apparent reason. I tried contacting customer support, but all to no avail. I needed my money back at all cost, because i could not afford to let it go. So i tried all possible means to make sure i recovered my scammed bitcoin. I did a lot of online search for help, and tried to see if there were other people who had any similar experience. I stumbled upon a cryptocurrency forum were a couple of people mentioned that they had been through the same process but were able to recover their lost cryptocurrency, funds with the help of FirstMan. So i file a report and he was able to help me get back all my lost funds within two weeks.

Ppl only lose money they were stupid or bought into the idiocy of money with no work. They did not do due diligence to read the ebb and flow of their asset then lost liquidity. This applies to all 3 markets. 

Did the individual that lost money do their due diligence before they made the purchase? Yes or no? How much study did they do? What indicators were used? When did they buy, sell, short? 

Like buying a house in a sense. If you don't know the market, bought at a bad time, etc. No one to blame but yourself. Or should we pretend 2008 didn't happen? Or the housing crash prior to it?

GregGore,"Hey Hey James (and pals), I have some horrible news for you. But first I must say I enjoyed your video, and agree with most of it. NFTs and all these sh|tcoins are total rubbish and yeah a lot of people lost money playing with them. There are a lot of desperate people out there, look at those videos of those guys hounding Elon Musk asking him to mention some sh|tcoin or other so they can hype it and try make a buck. The whole industry is floored because the sh|t is in there diluting the good. But I have to ask you one thing, if you're so against this crypto industry, what are you going to do when your own government bans cash and issues you essentially ""digital credits"" direct to your bank? Well I hope you're in a better financial situation than I am because if you're not financially independent of ""the system"" which is shortly going to be going digital with all these CBDCs that are being treated and developed and planned, them you're going to be trapped with no other option than to use their digital currencies. And as it stands most of the ""money"" (IE. Currency) in circulation is digital, only a fraction of the total (money) in the system is cash. The rest is numbers put into the system by some bank clerk or trader etc. Creating ""profit"" by lending non existent money out. Yes crypto might be flawed but CBDCs and the actual FIAT money system is far worse!",2023-07-23T10:05:43Z
Mr. Nobody,"Truly a great video. You definitely don't know the important part of the crypto industry, but you are on point about the scamminess that fills it up. There are a lot of slimy people and a lot of fools.

Hopefully people take your video with a grain of salt and spend time doing their own share of research. I would not be surprised if you made this video so you can try to load up your own coffers with BTC, only to say you were in a couple years, then tell everyone to get as much as they can before it's too late... while you sell at the top.

I would not be surprised, but I don't think that is your plan. I simply think you don't understand the technology. My people who are crypto diehards don't even get it.

Jazil Zaim,"Really good video on the downside of crypto. However there are still a lot of engineers working in this space that is far past this meme hype side of the industry which actually makes crypto look pretty bad. The benefits of blockchain such as proof of ownership is going to come once we have scalable blockchains (Solana and Flow are getting close) and once we have good infrastructure such as what Threshold Network did for Ethereum network for encrypting content. There is a ton of development but a lot of the development is being done behind the scenes and away from the noise. I think more of the serious web3/crypto founders need to bound together to denounce these grifters because a lot of them are obsessing with crypto because they think it is easy money. The grifters are deceiving more people and not contributing much at all.

Overall I do see this as an exciting space to be in. But definitely very technical. The 13 years that you spoke about is something that can be said for AI as well. AI in the 1980s died down for nearly a decade and came back and forth because the use cases were very minor. Then now in 2023, we are in the 4th hype cycle of AI which has been going on since mid-2010s. Really complex tech does take time to develop. Crypto is just one of those. As an engineer in this space, I do have to say that I am with you on the grifters and absolutely despise them and I believe they should be condemned.",2023-07-12T06:42:43Z

It's been used and detoured from its original use which was to make something unique so that it can be traced. This video is very miss-leading as it tends to mix a bunch of things together and act as its normal when its not.

For instance it's like if I was grouping people living in mexico and people living in spain and saying they're the same, they have things in common but they definitely aren't the same. Props to you for the work you did though.",2023-07-06T00:06:02Z

Knut Holt,"I think crypto is supported by great fractions of the elite leadership of many countries because this scheme constitute a way to exployt ordinary people economically, control people,  and makes them powerless to fight back all kind of exploitation by the elite.

The crypto currency has no funding for stability of value. It greatly consumes electricity and computing power and makes these good soar in price. The technology is not as secure as claimed either. The cypto asset of an ordinary person can easily be robbed. The price of this asset can easily be manipulated by the elite to its own benefit.

It is symptomatic that crypto money has not been prohibited in most countries even though it is a direct competition to national currencies, a highly anomalous behavior that points to the lite and authorities themselves are involved in the fraud to control and exploit people.",2023-07-04T12:11:45Z

Matt,One of the easiest ways to see that crypto has no genuine value outside of optimism when it’s traded to try and profit is to simply look at the multiple token crashes over the prior year or so. Take an FTX as an example. They bailed out a bunch of currencies but the acquisitions were always done with their coin. But one of the clearest demonstrations of how these coins have no genuine value is that the almost instant crash that forced their bankruptcy was largely because their balance sheet and the sister company they didn’t disclose their ties too had their assets almost predominately in the FTT token which immediately freaked everybody out since liquidating it would tank it’s price. And there was immense concern since it allowed manipulation of the prior to prop up the value. That is a demonstration that there really wasn’t a true value to it outside of manipulation and mania. Or other examples of how so many tokens have to hold other non token assets on their books and how quickly they crash when it’s discovered that their assets are largely in various tokens. The tokens have value during good times but as soon as there’s any down turns where there needs to be faith in the value of the tokens to weather a storm they consistently tank as people run the bank time after time. Crypto appeals to people not as a true new currency but as a method to ideally make giant profits quickly but people often won’t come out to say that.,2023-06-24T14:49:36Z

JPGs were not the ideas that brought the standard to life, it was digital ownership. Whether or not that is feasible is a good discussion. Conflating NFTs and Bitcoin is dishonest. Mentioning greater fools theory, without acknowledging that you are describing the entire global economy and more specifically the inflationary fractional reserve system is disingenuous. You mention the waste of energy as though the only energy with value is made with fossil fuels, without acknowledging the energy of humans whose limited time on this planet is devalued the moment they cash their paycheck.

FreeSpeechIsDead,"I would say the whole banking and finance system is the worlds greatest scam. You only have to look where it originated from and the systems it employs.
Its basically a debt driven system where the only winners are the banks.
Fancy creating a banking system where you pay 'interest'. Its basically a system that is printing money from nothing and then adding interest to create more money from nothing, hence ever increasing debt that will never be paid back. 
Well in todays world they dont need to even print money. Someone in the bank just goes onto the computer, punches in a few numbers and VOILA, you have money that has come from nowhere, you then get a glorified IOU to give banks the availability to then lend out more fake money and for you to pay it back through hard labour and also pay interest on it.
Once the world goes full digital in currency the corruption and fraud will be astronomical and this is what they want.
The stock market in itself is just another ponzi scheme. The big players cash out and the small investors lose everything. There are numerous market crashes every single year where billions just disappear. The whole monetary system is a scam, its not just one form or currency.

This is why no country has wealth as every country and its consumers are in perpetual DEBT.
At the end of the day, many have made a lot of money through crypto and continue to do so. I myself could have doubled my money this year alone depending how much I was willing to put in because at its current rate it has more than doubled to what it was at the start of the year.
And everything you went through on this video, pretty much just explains how the world has become disillusioned with life in general through celebrities and 'influencers' where society has lost all touch with reality and obsessed into a digital future. 
All I gotta say is Im not concerned with crypto, its the very existence of the human race into the next 50yrs where humans will become nothing but cyborgs and controlled by microchips and computers.
Im just curious whether you yourself have crypto, because if you have then this whole video is kinda hypocritical.
Then again, isnt it actually a good thing if someone buys into crypto just to make some money and just allow all these other sheep follow the leader into buying into crypto to only raise your profits and then just pull out while the others behind you that keep buying into it led by all these celebs to raise its value just crash and burn.",2023-06-18T08:50:10Z

Jaydog,"6:32 I agree with some of this stuff but the one thing that bitcoin is good at it transferring money around the world at a low cost. I have many co workers that used to send money back to their home countries with western union getting charged 10% in fees where as they now send them paying 1-2% in fees. So in conclusion there is some value in the system but I do agree that it’s hyped way to much but also is going to hold a spot in the financial system for years to come.  The NFTs are so stupid, my brother copy and pasted a picture of doge dog on a shit and turned it into an NFT and made 2k in 24 hours by selling it. 🤦🏻‍♂️",2023-06-13T14:39:49Z

Same happened in late 1990s. The dotcom bubble and the thousands  of dodgy projects that went burst, which turned out to be scam projects.

That bubble gave birth to Google, apple, Amazon, Microsoft and so on.
But hey, I was already around, and sure enough there were James Janis writing about the scam that was going on and how could people even think if investing in such an obvious Ponzi.

The point being, you might be right, or maybe in part. Maybe you have a clear idea of what your message has to sound like but not ready enough to accept the changes the future brings.

I'm sure you carry a mobile phone, and probably use for calls and messages. Watch YouTube vids but also take pictures (not using a Polaroid, are you?).

If we follow your line of reasoning, we could also label the dollar as a Ponzi scheme, considering it gains in value when demand increases. Being the most highly decentralized asset in the world, Bitcoin is arguably the safest existing asset.

It's essentially been a ticking time bomb for decades, particularly punctuated by the 2008 sub-prime mortgage fiasco and the subsequent collapse of Lehman Brothers. At LEAST since before then the entire financial machine could be argued has been artificially 'propped-up' and is now wholly sentiment driven.

I believe in the blockchain technology and the verified code of bitcoin more than US gov astronomical debt & thier currency manipulation.

You say that bitcoin ment to be p2p cash and now it's become store of value. So people are manipulating and some are making huge money. What do you say about DOLLAR?

See what you are complaining about is the equivalent of giving ""the people"" all the erector set pieces of the world and then demanding what they do with it what YOU want.

Are there a LOT of scams, absolutely. were there a lot of scams in the early days of the internet... absolutely.

But the technology can be used for amazing things, the problem is most of those things either A, don't yet exist because someone has to invent them...

OR people like yourself you click bait titles and spend a hour convincing people the whole thing is a scam and creating fear completely overshadowing good, new or inventive ideas. The people that are often trying to make good of the tech are small ( think less than 5 people, and more often one or two people) that do not have the resources to make headline news cycles. So by the time they come to market your message of Evil, doom and gloom is so saturated, and you got your clicks out of it that you could honestly give a fuck less.

You are just as much a part of the problem as the people using the tech to scam people.",2023-05-23T21:43:01Z

Not to mention that bitcoin is not fungible (each unit is not the same as any other unit), you can get ""tinted"" coins without even knowing it, and as soon as they hit some big exchange or a service they will be seized from you.
Exchenges are centralized and require KYC, yet provide little to no legal guarantees.

Seppl XY,"""Ok, let's make it clear that you didn't understand Bitcoin. And with spooky music in the background, you might be fooling people, but you certainly aren't fooling me. If you claim that Bitcoin is a waste of energy, you can certainly say it like that. However, the justification is not provided. You can probably imagine how much energy traditional banking requires. Also, dismissing the entire narrative of NFTs and lumping everything together to create a negative impression of Bitcoin right from the start is quite thoughtless in my opinion. Well, I can recall that one of the greatest economists, Adam Smith, said: wealth should arise from labor. Can't that be digital, do you think? If you consume goods and require energy, and then perform work to obtain new energy in the form of a currency, is that considered energy waste? Okay, you also claim that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. And of course, there's no anti-Bitcoin video without mentioning Bernie Madoff XD. However, the catch is who started it and who continues to participate. Apparently, there is a marketplace that sells something and buyers who accept it. Just a normal trading day for me, where I can choose to participate or abstain. The problem with your assumption is that if Bitcoin resembles a Ponzi scheme, you fail to understand that only Bitcoin provides an economic incentive. As I said, if the whole world is built on labor, why shouldn't our money be too? All other projects are simply not good, and every Bitcoiner knows that. 98% will not be needed in the future. The statement that I need a third party for, let's say, government documents is not entirely correct. Digitization will play a significant role in the future, whether it works with blockchain or not, as the blockchain itself is an inefficient technology for data storage. All in all, one can only say that your reporting raises more questions than it answers, which can be seen as poor reporting. Everything around Bitcoin (Altcoins)  is simply not economically correct, and I can agree with you on that. If you are confident about the things you say, then you must also be willing to listen to other opinions that are supported not only by narratives but also by logical reasoning. Nonetheless, thank you for your video.",2023-05-17T13:14:51Z

M S,"Blockchain is incredibly clever & powerful

It might just be the perfect digital virus

Cryptocurrencies are a human creation & digital medium of exchange that sits outside many existing legal frameworks & therefore have quickly become an extension of human psyche & like everything else that is marketable crypto has become a proxy for human behaviour - greed, deception, narrative, marketing, inflated valuations.....

It's just a modern & digital platform that allows people to exchange currency without government intervention or taxation - to a point

It can be argued that the price of gold is overinflated & will become less relevant as advances in asteroid mining & nuclear fusion progress

It can be argued that national borders & countries with governments are the ultimate Ponzi scheme where a ruling class inflicts it's will on the majority of citizens despite not really contributing anything to GDP, health, commerce, agriculture or science.... 

Courts of law & the ability of politicians to create laws is only possible due to armed forces - police & armies & prisons - without weapons & enough people unwittingly playing a small part in keeping communities focused on economic activity & commerce - how would governments collect taxes & enforce punishments for crimes against people & the fictitious nation

It will be incredibly difficult to stop existing & new cryptocurrency coins - especially as the world becomes more digitised - maybe at some point if most humans are replaced by robots & AI there could be an end to the inflated values attached to cryptocurrency - but when this occurs it will likely impact other asset classes on similarly overpriced garbage

Humans have created cryptocurrency & blockchain & humans have attributed value to crypto coins just as humans have drawn lines on pieces of paper & erected fences that signify ownership of parts of Earth as if they will exist forever.....

Where do you draw the line?

Why do people buy soft drink & alcohol?

Why do people gamble?

Why do people still allow themselves to become sunburnt?

Why do people smoke cigarettes?

Why can you buy a petrol car that is capable of exceeding the legal speed limit by 100km+?

Why are there so many successful criminals?

It's all because most humans are animals & flawed & driven by primal urges & instincts that are difficult to master or tame & indeed for the majority of people it seems too difficult to even try & think deeply about modern life, daily choices & acting with morals & respect

Crypto is simply another game which most people lose because they don't really understand it or need it or have much idea about how technology, economics & politics shape modern life.....

Maybe crypto is a scam?

Maybe politics is a scam?

It's not hard to see the appeal of crypto in a corrupt & corporate controlled modern world & crypto is just another part of corrupt & corporate systems despite trying to exist outside of modern government restrictions

Funny how BTC is quoted in USD!!!

USD is backed by weapons & infrastructure & legal & political guilds & games

Crypto is not governed by these systems but to say it exists without interacting with corporations & governments is naive

Crypto does not exist without networked computers running on the internet using government & corporate infrastructure.....

Everything is an illusion to some extent - it all just depends on if individuals have a choice to ignore or are forced to keep participate in games & systems that perpetuate, sustain & contribute to keeping alive the biggest illusions backed by weapons & laws & money.....

Crypto is a scam

Inflation is a scam

Politics is a scam

Consciousness is an illusion that allows infinite stacking of increasingly complex energy systems & illusions.....",2023-05-15T16:01:47Z

Like, what were you actually, buying and trading anyway. And I have yet to see an explanation of it, that has helped me understand it better.

I surely agree with you on the fact that there are 99% of coins out there that are fuuull of s... but the core idea of all of it being a ponzi, well that's also true to the €$£ and their respective financial intermediaries spreading credit with fractional reserve. One would just wonder which option is the best !?

Even though I disagree with some claims, your video is still absolutely right in most of the topics. We see blockchain here & there but in reality there are very few cases in which it is worth the extra spending of distributing the ledger to get it immutable and uncensorable. Cause in the end, these two things are the only benefit of having a token and its blockchain. We shall focus on what are the critical usecases where trust & censorship are problematic... putting jpegs & random url into this... what a waste.

I did invested in Bitcoins and Ethereum and a few others. Bitcoin isn't backed by any real world property or by a powerful entity like states. It only has its value bcoz people believe it does which is kinda scary imo. But I do think the Crypto Technology has potential. Decentralized banking system where u can be ur own bank, the fact that u can send money from anywhere around the world freely and safely. The technology itself has potential.  Also you didn't mention some countries who were relying on foreign currencies adopting Bitcoins and the CBDCs the governments are trying to make.  I do hope the time bomb wouldn't blow up anytime soon as I hold some as well. With all that said, I do think this video is a bit biased. It would have been better if u take a more neutral stance.

FreeFlyer,"What a load of rubbish. Blockchain technology simply allows anyone with programming skills to create any financial product they want. In addition to that, owning something on the blockchain is the digital version of owning and transferring a physical object (it requires no 3rd party). Why should these abilities be reserved for a tiny select few?

It's early days and very experimental. Everyone is playing with the tech, nerds getting rich and the world is full of dumbasses. Of course scams are out there and things get crazy and ridiculous. This is how the internet was in the early 90s.

EDIT: Originally Bitcoin was 7 transactions per second, it's now far greater. Will update with any further false info as I go through :P

EDIT2: Christ... ""Only make money because someone else lost more"". That is not how markets work. Every stock uses the same model. The whole world is run on this model. Buy orders and sell orders in the order book can move the price without any actual executions. But obviously you knew this before releasing the video.

EDIT3: Pretty good coverage of NFT artwork though. The way NFTs are being used is completely bogus really. But the technology isn't ""bad"", it's just a way to store a certificate on-chain. Think concert tickets. I was buying concert tickets, selling them and making sure I was towards the front in line to get in before the buyer before crypto even existed. The tickets were just PDF files, they can be copied. If tickets were NFTs, that solves that issue without a centralised platform which tickets are sold through today and can only be bought / sold within that platform for that reason.

Whats going on now with NFTs is pure hype and speculation yes. But there are good uses for having a certificate which you own, and can transfer without a 3rd party intermediary. If we ever expect virtual worlds and 3D internet in the future as opposed to flat 2D web pages, this is necessary technology.",2023-05-11T16:18:00Z

Danny P,"No no no no no. This is not a scam at all. Its just a clear way of understanding why money in general has value.

Some people believe that money has power, and others believe that belief has power. If you believe something has value, then it will. Money is just the accumulation of everyones beliefs. The more people that believe, the more value it has. The less people believe, the less value it has. This is exactly why some currencies loose there power of value, while others gain.

Cryptocurrency is in a sense, the most perfect set of money ghe world has ever known. Its because, (unlike goverment money) atkeast all the people of the world has full control of it, and there is nothing governments can do about it. 

Your video can be applied to all forms of currency in a sence, but you need to include the accumulated beliefs of individuals to increase the value of a certain currency and make that the foundation of your understanding of it. Then you will have a much mire clearer picture of exactly what currency and vakue if monye really is. That makes all the difference.

Its not a scam at all. Scams are designed to scam, don't do that at all. Its just a system of accumulated value. If its a scam, who looses? Fact is that the only way someone looses is if people stop believing it has value. 

It really is that simple. Its why you need a one hour documentary describing it, its because your logic is theory based, with little foundation. You're creating theories out of thin air, then your linking the theories together without a foundation and calling it circumstantial evidence that proves your right. But you are leaving out the foundation of exactly what money really is. 

Build your theories from the true foundation of what money really is and your picture will be clear. Then you can describe it with a couple of paragraphs of words like i am now.

The simplest explanation tends to be the correct explanation",2023-05-11T06:47:55Z

Even having the markets open over the week end is a scam ... the real professionals cannot intervene ... So the founders who would be very wealth, would have enough to play supporting central bank during the week end and give a lift to the value of the crypto.

there was no argumentation of WHY the technology doesn't work and should therefore not succeed. Technology works as intended and is evolving, endless use cases you can find in google. Usecases are legit, the price is just 100% speculation, like everything in the stockmarket, if you believe the stockprices are not 100% speculation & 100% manipulated you should educate yourself. Tulips are also legit plants, the price was just 100% speculation, but you cannot say tulips are not legit.

I do like that these collectible manias create hard to regulate pawn-trade communities though. It's like nomadic tribe trades of pottery, guns, drugs, instruments, jewelry, and art, but for digital nomads, and without dealing with antiquity police who are like Indiana Jones screaming, ""THAT BELONGS IN MY MEUSEUM"" and third-party appraisals. Like all ketch and camp though, such products are money taken out of the banking system, but are still essentially on your smart phone, which you can take anywhere... SO. there is value in that, if there is value in the product. I think there will eventually be a blockchain product I buy, probably transferable licensing agreements, or property deeds for places and vehicles, and creating digitally acceptable copies of legal records, and such. (Basically, a digital legal file cabinet / safety deposit-box, handling real property, but the technology has not been utilized for civil-law / common-law purposes yet.)  So, I can't scoff the technology despite the earliest iterations and utilizations being weak and very scam-like, but there's things I don't like about it... the energy requirements and intentional increasing difficulty that will eventually bottleneck transaction speeds. I could have made a radical fortune on these technologies, but I just didn't believe in them, I believed the UN would absolutely crush crypto-market over environmental reasons, or sanction-enforcement reasons, and it still might. But at least one nation has made Bitcoin it's official currency, so what we are looking at is a black-swan event with a very uncertain future. And AI is another black-swan event.

Katbaloo,There are bad people everywhere.  What they aren't telling you is that ISO20022 is the new banking standard for the transfer of money.  money transferred in SECONDS rather than days and for less than a penny per transaction.  This can only happen with ISO20022 digital assets & the blockchain which keeps a permanent record of all transactions .... crypto.  What is a scam is the unbacked fiat that they've been printing since God knows how long.  In 1971 Germany called America's bluff and wanted their money back in gold.  THAT's when tricky Dick took the dollar off the Gold backed standard.  He announced that it was supposedly temporarily halting the swap of dollars for gold.  That they would not entertain speculators.  The rest of the world wants out.  There is nothing backing fiat except the petro dollar and that is coming to an end.  Remember 2008.,2023-05-05T23:25:50Z

Money will cease to exist by 2030 according to the UN Agenda 2030. So by this time you will either buy goods with CBDC under the supervision of your central bank or you will buy them with Bitcoin the way you want. It is your choice, a choice between freedom and being subject to the government. Keeping your dollars is no option, because the dollar will eventually be phased out.",2023-05-05T21:42:17Z

Mach Fiver,"Want to hear lame? I opened a coinbase account and bitcoin wallet back when bitcoin was worth aproximatley $3.25 CAD (2011 era) and thought meh I'll wait till it drops back down to a buck each or so. I even downloaded a miner and set it up on a desktop I wasn't using but never started the mining proccess after the initial setup and test to see if it was working. Yup I could have used my home desktop to mine bitcoin back when that was possible. AND I DIDN'T DO IT OR BUY ANY AT ALL. FML I deserve to be forever poor. What a fuck up.

Anyway today I have become disillusined with what bitcoin has become or maybe I just realized what it actually is. It doesn't make buying online faster or cheaper at all and going from fiat to bitcoin to fiat again just eats away at your money way more than any bank fee or paypal fee could ever do. And that's before you get scammed and robbed or your computer HDD dies along with your wallet and it's keys and all you bitcoin is lost forever or until quantum computers become powerful and accessible to the masses so you can crack your wallet open. I mean how awesome is it that $500 of bitcoin costs you more than %10 to buy? At the bitcoin ATM in my local grocery store it was around 25% of the amount you were buying and to sell back again was even worse. And if you accidentally tap send instead of cancel when you realize the other guy is a scammer youre unable to cancel the transaction or even know who they were. The only true owners of bitcoin that use it to buy htngs are criminals spending their illegal earnings. And now they can buy prepaid visas that allow atm cash withdrawls they don't even need to cash out to a bank thriugh an exchange that uses KYC protocols for users. It is a joke. And the resources to mine a bitcoin just in electricity is beyond profitable unless you are able to set up in Iceland and get cheap power or steal hydro but don;t bother mining if you don;t own a couple hundred ASICs that cost $50k each and expect to have ti buy them all over again once someone invents a better ASIC miner system and your couple mil investment in hardware is obsolete. Just how is mining profitable at all especially with the recent plumet in bitcoins price. It can;t be profitable today but only on the gamble that bitcoin will go back up or surpass it's previous price and hiit a mil percoin one day. I laugh at the price predictors that say by 2030 bitcoin will be at 750k USD I find that very hard to believe. 

And finally just actually what is bitcoin? It's electronic pretend money that has zero tangible backup to an asset like gold. It;s electronic pretend money that someone created and made a funky enticing way for people to be able to create more and also take care of all the accounting and bookkeeping at no cost to themselves. They took a gamble and boy did it pay off and as long as they don;t sell off their holdings in huge chunks but little by little they won;t cause the price to totally tank rendering them just as broke as before. They live like a king and personally I'm in awe of them and thiunk it;s amazing that they accomplished what they did. I wish I had done more to get some way back when but I didnt. I could gamble today but I'd like my odds better buying the occassional lottery ticket and hitting the proggressive slots at my local casino.",2023-05-05T02:28:44Z

Crypto use case is sending money around the world 0 fee's. 

Not bitcoin F that one. 

Algo. XLM many others. 

CBCDs are crypto do you think the govt doesnt see use case,? 

Instant spy ware money they control. 

That itself creates use cases for BTC. To avoid the cbdc bs. 

 Working for food stamps China is stopping peopke from using their own money in other cities theyve been banned from visiting. Like journalist's. Putting expiry dates on proples money use it or lose it.  That will solve inflation lol. 

I think ide rather keep buying real crypto 

97% of British finance is digital now. Only we have 0 knowlege of it. 

Crypto changes that 

Dont want to fund war have your bank account inflationary deflated use deflationary inflated instead. 

Nobody is saying im so happy i didnt buy bitcoin in 2010 2014  2018. 

Ill gamble on that being true in 2030 looking back to now.

Thats what i tell people just watch and learn dont jump into it when its pumping like crazy thats when you should be selling what you already had. So i put $50 away each month. I quit weed so its up in smoke either way atleast crypto has a chance to bring it back. 

Look at the life time charts 100.000% gains isnt uncommon i swear some had or have 1milluon % gains imagine that.

Goddesses StarTrek Online Fleet,"The truth of BitCoin. BitCoin was invented in the late 1990's, it was formed as a company offering a ""digital currency for games"". BitCoin was a single company but it had invented a software system that could scale by adding new 'nodes' into the network. They also were consious that in assigning a physical value to a digital asset, hacking would happen, so, they made a very specific protection mechanism. Firstly, the more nodes that where added to the network the more complex and larger the crytogaphic calculation; Secondly, they presumed people would try to ""brute force"" their way to try to falsely generate coins and thus devalue the currency. They put in place two safe guards, firstly, every time new BitCoin transactions are created it changes the cryptographic key and secondly it increases the cryptographic difficulty in brute forcing the key. Thus, at the system operated it was though to be defended against hacking and ""as safe as real money"" (so they felt). This company gained a mild success, associating itself with popular games of the time. Gamer's used it as a ""intermediary"" currency, as a mechanism to ""safeguard"" a transaction. BitCoin the company did well. However, hackers where not to be beaten. Hackers worked out a way to continiously generate new coins using processor intensive mathematics and effectively bankruppted BitCoin. This meant the hackers had reverse engineered its operation. BitCoin went quietly away (as a company) and the creators where lost to time. Roll on the 2000's, presumably one of the hackers who had compromised the original coin network, had a bunch of BitCoins left, which where now valueless without a company to back them. Assumably they where trying to figure a way to make these BitCoins have value again, and invented the myth of Satoshi Nakamoto. Also, as hackers, wanted to promote the idea of a currency which was outside the control of corporations (which also neatly falls into how they got burned when the BitCoin corporation went bankruptt). From there forward, the ""hacking"" of BitCoin was ""mythologised"" as ""Mining"" and said to be ""by design""! It was of course not intended for ""mining"" but they re-skinned the original security feature as an intentional system to ""make coins"" as this was largely the only way the hackers knew how to generate coins. There's alot more following that, and you pick up that part of the story pretty well.",2023-05-04T07:47:36Z

st. lamplight,"What is gold?  Why is it valuable? Ultimately, its value is determined by supply and demand in the market. It doesn't really have any intrinsic value. Its value is determined by supply and demand. The reasons behind the demand are almost entirely superficial (status, symbol of wealth, hard to mine, limited supply). The demand for Bitcoin is similar, but I would say slightly more interesting. It comes from a collective desire to carry out transactions that bypass political controls, banking controls, and to have an inflation-resistant store of value. What does Bitcoin do? Well, what does gold do? It doesn't matter. It comes back to human psychology and supply and demand. Honestly, was a little disappointed with the research in this one. Production was great. But the content was shallow. Didn't go into economic theories, the history of money and value, inflation, trade, government managed money supplies, etc. He had a theory and kept his blinders on and didn't consider the non-hype reasons why people like Bitcoin.

Also how is it a ponzi scheme? How is Bitcoin a ponzi scheme if anyone can buy or sell freely in the market, and there is no central authority or organization that controls or manages its price? Bitcoin does not promise guaranteed returns or payouts to investors using the capital from new investors. Like gold, which doesn't promise guaranteed returns or payouts, people buy bitcoin because it's in demand.",2023-05-03T20:31:00Z

Crypto currencies were invented by Free Mason Luciferians as one of the ways to collapse fiat money becouse they want to get rid of cash and replace it with CBDC to have complete 100% control over people. One of the most common slogans of Free Masonary: ""We will build prison for people by their own money"". Blockchain technology and crypto curiency in particular reflect that. CBDCs will use blockchain but before it could be introduce first they need to test it in many different ways to make sure no one will be able to hack it so that's why you have so many crypto currencies - to find and test the best version for CBDC digital prison and people who are spending real money on that are just investing in their own future enslavenent.

The problem is that crypto is not better nor is it practical. When was the last time you bought a pack of cheese with bitcoin? Or filled your car's tank with gas with bitcoin? It just doesn't work. You can't rent hotels, buy plane tickets, buy bread, or order a book from amazon with bitcoin. And of course your employer will still pay you in your native currency, too. It's completely worthless. And those computer generated ape pictures are even less than worthless. I'd actively avoid being associated with those unsightly things.
But even if it did work, what does bitcoin achieve? A waste of resources is what it does. Terrawatts of power, better spent on weather predictions or scientific simulations are going down the drain. Entire industries get created wasting thousands of manhours. I want a new graphics card and have to pay 3 times the price. And who gets rich? Who owns the most bitcoin? The chineese government, because they can afford to buy up all those graphics cards and stamp out data centers with slave labor to mine bitcoins and power them with coal power plants.

mehtasid,"I don't have a firm view either way, but if crypto is a scam, then expensive paintings, old postage stamps, vintage cars etc. that have much lower utility value than they sell for, should also be a scam.  However we are comfortable that these sell for millions because we grew up with these.   OTOH, if you agree that a rare vintage Ferrari can be worth a million, then so can crypto.  For anything to have value, all it takes is millions of people agreeing it has value.  For example the same house in an expensive neighborhood is double the price because everyone accepts that.  If so, it's the same for crypto.  Once millions accept that it has value, then it does, because there will always be buyers and sellers at that price.   You can argue that one day there might not be buyers.  Well, when the earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989 there were no buyers so the houses suddenly went down in value.   But no one says houses are a scam.   Please feel free to post opposite views if you are logical, polite / civil.

Gold, especially physical gold, DOESN'T multiply, except as an INVERTED pyramid scheme balanced on its tip at the point of the establishing physical gold leverage.

Before you ask what I know you want to ask, ask yourself what fiat currency is based on and consider that since 1970 the USD has lost 99% of its value. Given that, fiat has pretty neat adoption doesn't it.",2023-04-30T11:31:09Z

We all know your fiat paper dollar loses value over time through inflation.  So using Jani's logic, something that loses value makes better money than something that gains value. This is the kind of bullshit MSM talking heads bring up to justify inflation.

If you have two coins with $10 value stamped on it, and you know one of them is pure gold, and the other one is gold mixed with scrap metal, you will make sure to spend the scrap coin first, and save the pure gold one.

you don't
You take your dollar and give it to the bank, they hold onto it and loan 90c to Dave, only they charge interest so Daves debt can never be repaid, unless he puts his money in the bank where the bank can lend out 81 more cents to Jill and Ian, charging interest on the payment.

These Corps want their bottom line increased every year, for what... I'm not sure... greed... (I work for one, and I hate it with every fiber of my being, just can;t say shit... sigh) so each year they end up raises the cost of their services, but the workers pay do not get raised via the same rate...so people can no longer survive and must look outside of their normal skill set or what they usually do to earn and crypto has been one such place. It sucks, everything sucks... and many of us are depressed. Money is corrupt and even though humans invented it, we have very little access to it, and we treat money like a God almost, you can't just have this.

But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness.

Oliver L.,"I don't want to burst anyone's bubble but let's just say that bitcoin, or cryptocurrency's inception was likely created by people who are anti-government who clearly doesn't want to pay taxes or give governments knowledge of their business, which clearly shows it's something sketchy. I think it's safe to assume that those who are into cryptocurrency are those who are tech savvy who earn a living mainly through the net where anything goes (whatever criminal activity) and somehow they get away with it. Imagine if cryptocurrency becomes the norm, they can easily steal your money (or rather, coins) by hacking which is very common among tech savvy people. Now, imagine that the tech savvy person in question is a thief, the risk is even much higher. It's like giving a gun to a crazy person, or animal, perhaps a monkey. If they could steal data from you, they could steal anything. And because these transactions aren't reported to the government, you can't get any help when things fall apart. Perhaps the biggest consequence of cryptocurrency is that, when no one pays taxes anymore, then society would eventually deteriorate. Who would pay for hospitals,  roads, general maintenance and basic amenities that generally come from taxes? Yes, it is true that most governments are infested by corruption, but that's not to say they're all bad. And I don't believe that the best approach is to overturn any government because when that happens, crimes rise, and society becomes a total dystopia.",2023-04-29T20:38:22Z

To elaborate my opinion, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have no use at the moment, that being said, it doesn't eliminate the chance it will have use in the future. ""When in the future?"" I'd say banks are now creating their CBDC, which is based on blockchain, but instead of being decentralised is completely centrilised, when this switch turns, from cash to digital, cryptos like bitcoin will have its real propose fulfilled, keep transaction out of government and banks flowing, with that being said the value of crypto will rocket.

coffeegator,"I don't think it's entirely accurate to say that all cryptocurrencies and anything associated with them is evil and a scam. For instance, let's say you lived in a country where the value of your nation's currency dropped tremendously. If you had part of your portfolio hedged with a solid crypto (yeah I'm mentioning it as an investment, but it's my money, and I'll do what I want with it, and bear with me a sec), it would then (here's where the currency payoff part comes in) be worth lots of spendable cash for you if you were able to access it in your country and living situation or were able to cross into another country to access it. It is currency. It's just mainly used as a savings and/or investment account. Investing in forex is very foreign and intimidating to most people, but I'm sure that more people know how to buy bitcoin or know someone who can help them especially when compared to people who invest in stock markets.

I think the crypto trend has awoken many new investors in stock markets now since it definitely introduced new investing concepts to them. If that ends up putting more money into the market eventually then great. I like a more stable economy and hope that I'll never be in a situation where my crypto investments were all that I had left in the world.",2023-04-27T22:40:32Z

ollj oh,"all crypto is 100% lie and fraud, and the classic cult of ""invent a problem/disease, to sell a cure/solution""
besides being an obvious ponzy-sceme, any claim that any crytocurrency made, about being (even potentially) a superior alternative in any way to even best or worst mineral or fiat-currency for trade/investing is false, and an obvious lie, because it is all a lie for theft.
no crypto is better in any way than even worst inflating fiat currency.
All crypto is BY DESIGN monopolistic, and ""smart contracts"" just make their monopolies much worse, while claiming to be ""peer to peer decentralized"" it is inherently monopolistic+pyramidSchemed BY DESIGN, INTENTIONALLY.

It gets worse, in terms of promoting the insanity, of burning coal to heat water to generate electricity, for theft of a ponzy scheme. the act of burning coal to generate energy alone should be globally criminalized like the use of CFCs, an and promoting large-scale-energy-waste-for-fraud should be just as criminal.

it gets WORSE from there, because ""lie and murder for theft"" has the pseudonym ""genocide"", and you can be sure, that crypto is used for money laundering, and that attracts criminals that do not shy away from homicide/murder.
I can EASILY jump from crypto/nft to genocide, because: bored-ape-jacht-club is literally a hitler worshipping nazi cult in disguise. Other youtube videos make coherent and reasonable arguments for this claim. nft/crypto is made for fascists, by fascists, out of fascists.

You are great at pointing out that many crypto currencies will fail. So do many tech companies that have nothing to do with crypto, on the NASDAQ. So what?

Fabian,"So the thing is.. this is done really well. It's entertaining. But it's also clearly biased and follows a narrative. 
Or in other words, it's one of those videos which could convince the audience of any given opinion, unrelated to the actual facts.

As someone with a masters degree in computer sciences, i at least understand the majority of what's happening under the hood. 
That doesnt mean i necessarily disagree on a few key points here, so let me quickly clarify that:
* Bitcoin is trash. It was a proof of concept, and a successful one. But it never had a chance to become a global currency and serves no real purpose nowadays.
* The images *are not* NFTs. NFTs are digital certificates of ownership, nothing more and nothing less. The payload, so to speak, is irrelevant. You simply verifiably own that. That's it.
* Crypto does cause a few manias here and there. A lot of people make, and many more lose money on that. However, one should *never* invest based on FOMO alone. 
* Manias and FOMO, or bad investment strategies in general, are not unique to the crypto scene. 
* As with anything else, if money is to be made, people will do what it takes to profit on it. People are bad, and love to profit off of others. That doesnt mean the tech is bad.
* Crypto does however indeed attract a lot of scammers, and many projects are scams. We are at an early stage which is easy to abuse, but that's not the techs fault either.
* ""For them to get rich others are left without their investments"" - yes thats how markets work. Like all of them. Somebody always buys at a higher price, for someone else to be able to sell.

With that out of the way: blockchain technology such as crypto currencies or NFTs are not scams. The story you deliver has a very strong bias against such technology. That much should be clear from the phrasing alone. You compare Bitcoin transactions to VISA, rightfully concluding that it doesnt stand a chance. I agree. It sucks. Few with half a clue would argue against that. However, what about less prehistoric solutions, which outshadow the performance of VISA nearly as much as VISA outshadows Bitcoin? Nah, that doesnt fit the narrative being pushed here, huh. The same with the power consumption. Yes, we get it, and i agree: Bitcoin sucks. It was a proof of concept, and it did its job. It has no real usecase anymore and wont scale to global usecases. But just like with the transactions.. what about those that can? Proof of work is very energy hungry. People realised that pretty quickly. Proof of stake, one of its successors, is orders of magnitudes less energy hungry, and there is even newer models being tested which reduce energy consumption even further. Compared to the banking system we got now, a final product will likely end up being orders of magnitudes cheaper and better for the planet. But that doesnt fit the narrative either.

Now, i dont really care about crypto currencies specifically. They will eventually replace fiat money, but whether that happens in a decade or a millenia, i neither know nor care. The banking system is worth billions, rather trillions, so even if some crypto currency, hypothetically speaking, was superior in every aspect, it would have a hard time replacing the current system - just like oil and coal companies do all they can to slow green energy nowadays. 
Blockchain technology itself is however revolutionary. It allows trustless certification of digital ownership. People have always spend tons of money on digital assets. Whales in MMORPGs oftentimes spend thousands, if not tens of thousands per month. Some CSGO players spend hundreds of thousands, or even millions, on skins. Digital assets are worth whatever people are willing to pay for them, just like real art. There isnt really any difference here.. except that you *do not* actually own these assets, and you can lose them with no trace left. The company providing the service can go bankrupt and turn off the servers. Your account may be banned, even undeservedly so. All you get for buying a game is the right to play. You dont actually own anything, even if you buy it. You also cant, legally, sell it, even if that's oftentimes done. 
If only we had technology allowing us to verify ownership of digital assets, enabling us to truly own something we paid or worked for, and as a byproduct enabling us to sell it externally, legally. Oh wait. We do. Digital ownership is required for certain tech, and will eventually be commonplace. So much so that you wont notice you are using it. Many things will be NFTs, and noone will have to use the term or care about the topic at all. After all, it's just fancy, fantastic technology.. nothing more, and nothing less. What people do with it on the way there, that's a whole other story. But is anybody really arguing against people being assholes?

TL;DR: The technology itself is not a scam. How could it be? The statement itself is ridiculous, ignorant even. The scene is however infested with scammers. That is the case for various reasons, but mainly because a) the tech is new, b) the tech is extremely complicated, making it easy to fool people and c) people loving the idea of making a quick buck by investing in something they dont understand are the exact type of ""customer"" scammers are looking for. Easy to scam, gullible people. As complex as the technology is, i wont say it's anybodys fault for being scammed. That's just not the case. However, most people who get scammed invested into technology they dont understand, for reasons they shouldnt have. The tech is complicated. If you invest in something this early you have to know what you are doing. Eventually you wont have to know how a wallet works or what a blockchain is any more than you currently have to know how a client server architecture works, or what happens internally between you swiping your card and money being transfered from your bank account. That is a consumer-grade technology stage. Crypto simply is not there yet, but people act like it magically would have to be there, just to counteract their own mistakes and.. quite frankly: stupidity.",2023-04-19T20:13:14Z

Crypto space evolves every cycle and the main crypto Bitcoin still has the biggest use case to counter the devaluation of FIAT currencies. And you can't deny that.

you said energy was wasteful - in this context, energy cannot be wasted, only converted - waste is here subjective, not objective.
you said that 'real dollars' were being exchanged for crypto - dollars are a representation of value as cryptocurrencies are when bought with dollars - dollars are not backed by anything but debt and promises - they are about as real as a thought (or numbers/text on a computer)
you said that web3 was another buzzword for crypto. they are separate technologies. web3 is more needed now than ever before due to the rampant censorship of centralised platforms. there are many normal things I write in comments on YT that are deleted automatically. this is due to political influence and goes against common sense",2023-04-17T12:47:57Z

It was very well done, but it missed many points and made false dichotomies: ""Either I don't understand this technology or it's a giant scam fueled by greed and grifters"". It's both. You don't understand the tech and it's a giant scam. Or rather, it's 95% a scam. Just like the Dot Com Bubble. Just like the Railroad Bubble. New tech breeds speculation and scams. Look at Tesla. EV's are revolutionary and they're here to stay, but all of these new EV companies are popping up that will not be around in 5 years. Tesla was also founded by a grifter/scam artist- Elon Musk. Look up the history of Tesla. EV's were not invented by Musk.

A real pyramid scheme that you should consider making a video on is the US Dollar. You need a perpetual increase in debt for the system to work.  The song and dance about raising the debt ceiling every few years is a mockery to placate ignorant citizens when in actual fact they have no option.  Bitcoin isn't about tech it is about the economics and very nearly perfectly designed.   But allowing an elite group of people to create all the money you end up with a concentration of wealth serviced by interest rate slaves.  Even if you are debt free most of your tax services interest.

Governments and the world need to wake up and ban this sort of activity before it ruins the world and causes mass starvation, instability, wars and possible destruction of humanity. Unlike normal investments that create jobs, provides resources for humanity, this type of investing just takes money from or creates money out of of thin air, and without any substances.

 NFT's is also something that i am skeptical . 

Bitcoin thou is legal. 

Just because it exist in the digital world doesn't mean that it's completely fraud. 


All the scams associated with bitcoin comes from actors who glorified the use and value of the coin.

Bitcoin's value rise and falls just like real money. however bitcoin's value is govern by peers and not by the World Bank or any financial institution which can be manipulated by the government or any powerful individual. 

There are fake moneys in circulation but there are no fake bitcoin's in circulation. Blockchain in theory is foolproof.

Admittedly it goes against my personal convictions but if we were to channel my position outside of that I'd like to submit to you that people would feel more comfortable showing this to their children as a means to educate them on the harsh realities of the world if there were less cursing. I know I'd like for my son to watch this and my daughter too because she easily could've got caught up in that kitty crypto game and that other one with the fake pokemon as she loves cats particularly but likes cute animals in general. And no I don't hide the darkness of the world from them because how else will they be equipped and armed to combat schemes like this without either informative documentaries like this or tragic firsthand experience as I know many children were fleeced by this and even games like Roblox. Other than that quarrel bravo I was truly enlightened by this video and at one point I wanted my son to research crypto investment strategies but now I have no motivation to do that seeing as at best it's a legal casino and it's it's very worst it's MLM of the worst sort.

Only choice if you don’t want to be left behind is to play it and don’t get too greedy",2023-03-24T15:49:08Z

YALLA636,"Saying at the end of the video that blockchain didnt brought anything new to the table in over 13 years is proof for a super delusional research by the video creator, cause bitcoin changed the way how we send money without a 3rd party like no other asset before and the best example is how even governments used Bitcoin to avoid sanctions in order to send money from one part of the world to another country. You can argue that Web3 is just a Marketing Slogan in 90% of cases, like VPNs that actually help decrypt and not encrypt. Yes most tokens are useless and everything works like a ponzi thatswhy the are called SHITCOINS, but talking about Bitcoin being a Scam and not even comparing it to the biggest scam called USD and how Dollar got depegged from Gold and how it is worthless paper printed from nothing is just misleading for a lot of viewers, even if a lot of things in your video are true.

Stephen Davidson,"First let me say great video. Bitcoin was doomed from the start in both design and application. There's too many mistakes to list here but the biggest ones was allowing it on the stock market which subjected Bitcoin to government rules and regulations it was designed to go against and the other was asigning a fiat currency value to Bitcoin itself. We was NOT supposed to price Bitcoin in Dollars, Yen, Yuan, Euros etc. It was supposed to stand on its own math value. The Bitcoin supply is also a problem and due to the way the code was written, it can NOT be changed without Bitcoin destroying itself. As far as excessive energy consumption goes, no not really. That was just someone spreading climate change BS. Visa and MasterCard alone consume 10 times more energy than Bitcoin mining does.",2023-03-15T23:54:28Z

In my opinion this technology is not hear to scam us. It is here to help us figure out a better way to operate in a world where we are struggling to trust our centralized institutions. But this stuff needs iterations, it needs to make mistakes, and continue to learn from them.

If you currently actually like the way our modern financial system is setup, then good for you. Please don’t participate in the crypto ecosystem.

You need to explore it much further and if you are a software programer it is not that hard to understand the concept of blockchain technology...but if you are not it is much easier to call it a scam.
Every major failure in crypto is caused by financial system and greed in it, not crypto.
NFTs are something new,I agree lot of NFTs are scam but there are also some with utillities, especially in defi.
I mean, if all NFTs are scam then all the paintings are scam even some of them cost millions of dollars...you can not use them for anything, just hanging there on the wall and as I already mentioned some NFTs have great utillities.

People see one scam and tell the people the whole of crypto is a scam but that's just wrong. Volkswagen manipulated their emissions but no one said ""Let's never buy any car again because Volkswagen fucked up"". If you really believe every crypto is a scam then you are stupid. FIAT Money like the USD is a scam. They printed 3 out of 4  existing dollars in the last 3 years only. Why would you want a currency that devalues itself so much? Everyone is saying ""everything get's more expensive"" but that's not the case - your money is loosing value and Bitcoin fixes this problem with it's limited supply. I will say it now. Everyone will regret not buying bitcoin by 2025 when the next bullrun tops out. Screenshot this if you want because I know I will be right. Mid-end 2025 mark your calenders.",2023-03-07T04:50:00Z

KELSYN21,"Please Explain to me why crypto(ripple tech) has been accepted in over 200 countries right along with IBM (Microsoft) more will join ripple no doubt about it when ripple's lawsuit ends and ripple will win it
 the system is up and ready to go and has been for sometime it ain't no scam it's happening right now as we speak.

FTX Ponzi scheme was done by design to scare consumers away from purchasing tokens early, and it has served it's purpose well, thanks to BlackRock and the mainstream media and channels like yourself. 
 i know people are gonna be rushing to buy like a pandemic crisis when it all starts up, the problem with that is there will be high price on supply and demand making the tokens highly valuable more expensive so jumping in later then now will hurt those who are not on board early, you will be forced into the govt(slavery) systems, they have already got tokens ready and waiting and buying more as we speak.
 why are they not pushing it now? because it's not there system, they don't control it they are customers hence the RIPPLE LAWSUIT. if they had won and had full control we would all be on crypto tomorrow and the chains of slavery will continue for many generations.

i feel sorry for the people who put everything in FTX and lost, but like i said it was designed to fail and fall from the beginning they didn't do there homework and got caught in the trap nothing wrong with the crypto system, SBF and BlackRock screwed every FTX investor over all for the purpose of scaring and keeping people out as long as possible.

 look at SBF case who bailed him out?(250mil)
who the hell has that sort of money not SBF, and why hasn't mainstream media questioned the origin and source to where this HUGE sum of money came from.
why did they go through all that trouble to free a criminal scumbag fraud.
SBF is backed by Blackrock we should all know who they are by now
 been putting families and lives in financial ruins for generations, the very people who have been telling us crypto is a scam yet they put the money together to free SBF. 
 bill gates is in partnership with ripple and XRP

Lola Dog,"You went into the creation of this project with your mind made up that crypto is bad. Then created a narrative to support it. This documentary is factually light, heavy on opinion, generalizations, and dozens of omissions designed to skew details in his favor. Bitcoin & Ethereum have completed 1.8 Billion combined transactions. The ledgers are transparent and available for anybody to personally review. Crypto is not anonymous like the myth suggested. It is highly volatile as any new sector is. Because all blockchain software is Open Source, anybody can download a copy of Bitcoin or Ethereum's clients and run nodes. You yourself can see what's happening. That is the very antithesis of a Ponzi. A Ponzi scheme requires opaque conditions where the investor doesn't know what's being done with their money. Bitcoin is the exact opposite. I've already given you more verifiable facts than this video did.",2023-03-06T17:03:28Z

""Why do modern-day revolutions fail? Even if free-minded individuals managed to create a breakthrough system or technology, it is quickly adopted by the Big money first. They either repackage it for their own needs and based on their own vision, or they destroy it by encouraging worldwide scams to take fruition and promise “get rich quick” hopes to the average person. Eventually leading the masses to denounce and despise a creation that would otherwise provide them with great Utility. 

The media then helps the People to destroy their own Salvation.""

However most people don't understand what is going on.  FTX fall had nothing to do with Crypto, but with just plain bad governance and bad investor decisions. Same with Enron. Plenty of corporate scandals out there. But FTX was quickly labeled as a symptom that something was rotten in Crypto. Was funny to see the spectacle on the media. Long term investors in Crypto are quietly having their cake, as their outlook is undoubtedly positive.  Like any investment do your home work, make your risk-reward analysis and make your own decisions - just and don't blame others for your mistakes.",2023-02-28T12:00:23Z
Left _Ventricle,"There seem to be quite a few people pointing out James’ points of view not being strictly factual, but that in turn reveals those were missing the argument of this video.

The point he makes is how the tech, wherever it comes from, is utilised in ways that are more in alignment with ponzi scheme, than any legitimate use cases the inventor(s) has/have initially imagined. This is a good argument in itself. Perhaps more so, this means the understanding of tech itself is not as fundamental as it otherwise would have been. 

You can apply this core argument of ‘it’s used wrong no matter the origin narrative’ to various historical fields. Especially the WW2 era aviation tech. Not sure I can fully explain why, without having to write an essay-length comment though.


P.S.  If you ever feel the need for ferocious defense against any oppositions to whatever you protest for, it’s about time to pause a little, and evaluate if you are shaping facts around your belief, instead of creating beliefs around the observable facts.",2023-02-28T00:48:29Z

Regulators have refused to provide clarity in the USA for over 10 years and instead opt to use litigation to stifle projects that compete with established interests.

To start, your idea that Bitcoin’s only value is rooted in the “greater fool” theory of higher asset prices completely misses the revolutionary idea in the Bitcoin white paper: trust-less decentralized systems, self-sovereignty, and the worlds first global non-government money.

Because if crypto is a Ponzi scheme taking money from others into the hand of others and on the way building technologies that revolutionize the internet, you should say the same about the dot come bubble, the housing bubbles and pretty much any other investment thing on this planet. Because that takes money from others, in the stock market, from corporate investors, and in the case of crypto, also from retail investors, puts it into things that are speculative, helps build them and on the way, some make it, most crash.

Add to this the complete and utter lack of stability of crypto's value, and you have several reasons this can't ever work as a currency and it's only really good for speculation.

Also saying that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme is wrong on so many levels people who are in the space know that Bitcoin isn't a currency it is a form of store of value.
It takes the properties of gold but makes it more mobile.

Anything that a big enough group of people believe has value is valuable. What's the intrinsic value behind USD? nothing.

Tommy Wonder,We have no control over interest rates can't print our own currency struggle to reach our goals more than ever that everything is controlled by few. Who's scamming who? We live in a lie that hard work will lead us to financial freedom. Being taxed to death for politician whims retaking and diminishing our life's savings. We are duped into buying things we don't need in great volumes. So Bitcoin is in its infant stage quirky and evolving. Would it be so horrible if people were alleviated of financial imprisonment? Imagine how people would find their purpose and all the evil in the world would vanish.,2023-02-19T19:53:18Z
suspectx,"This guy got burned somehow, and this is his reply. No one knows what the future holds, you’re making a video that is ten years too early. The innovations “crypto” is creating and will create, is not known yet. 

There will be mistakes yes, there are people looking to make a quick dollar yes, but like all humans and even the revolution of A.I. Is that man or machine can learn from their mistakes, and the innovation from these “scams” is going to knock people’s socks off 10 years from now. 

There’s not just scam artists in crypto, there are innovators with mind blowing ideas that will benefit humanity. 

Look more into those projects, than just the face value of what we’re currently seeing and look more into what the future may hold and the benefits that could possibly help people all around the world.  I don’t know the future, but I believe in innovation and the desire to create new technologies that work.",2023-02-19T19:07:20Z

Bitcoin's price has risen and fallen in a boom/bust cycle since its creation. It's just that usually the peaks and troughs are high than last time. People jump in when the price is high, then sell when it falls, and complain they've been conned. They haven't. They've just been stupid and greedy. The stock market works much the same way.

* there have been loads of worthless coins created, that people have jumped on, only to find they were worthless after all.",2023-02-18T23:03:55Z

wrfootball,"Good video I must say, but a few things he is incorrect on (IMO):
1. A bubble is not a scam.....its just hype and people buying in....nobody forces you to invest, so stop taking the easy path and blaming others...its YOUR responsibility.
2. There is nothing wrong with new technology and innovation...if its masked with a token (possibly a scam) then again DYOR.
3. There is alot of overlap with AI here in the WEB 3.0 narrative, it makes sense...we can see where its all heading. Do we seriously think that all technology stops here at web 2.0?! Yes its a risk, but no risk no reward....you're crazy if you go all in! 
4. Bitcoin uses lots of energy yes, but miners are now looking for cheaper solutions to lower their costs which creates innovation for cheaper energy! Michael Saylor has talked lots on this....its great idea!
5. Any asset you buy relies on someone paying a higher price, thats not unique to crypto. Remember these are NOT companies so of course there is no revenue generated. One can justify stocks because they generate profit....but thats just a way to justify it. Many things go up in price that are not companies, like old antiques sitting on your shelf at home. 

Crypto imo has value because I can send money instantly and dead cheap........cant do that easily with fiat! Theres value and a use case right there! Then you got self custody with hardware wallets and so many other use cases....its definitely valuable and the market shows that.",2023-02-18T09:49:59Z

Strath Attack,"There is one cryptocurrency that is actually useful and is pretty much everything that bitcoin was meant to be: private, decentralized, and you can actually use it as a currency much more efficiently than bitcoin. However most exchanges refuse to list it, governments are desperately trying to either ban it or at the very least de-anonymize it and currently most use of it seems to just be for the black market.

This just shows that even when a digital currency that could possibly replace a country's current currency, the government is gonna do all it can to stop people knowing about it and either banning or limiting how people can use it. The reason why bitcoin is okay in the government's eyes is because they know it's on a public blockchain therefore all transactions are public and not private, they also know it's not a threat to the existing currency. However as we move towards a cashless society, privacy coins such as monero does actually pose a threat, because if they take away cash, currently the one way we can make transactions privately, people will naturally move towards privacy coins to buy certain things they don't want anyone else knowing about. Even though I agree with this video that most cryptocurrencies are a scam, I do believe that a cashless society is unfortunately going to be here soon, and when that happens people will be looking for alternatives in order to make transactions anonymously, without the government seeing everything they're buying or selling.",2023-02-15T12:22:54Z

Stop lump Bitcoin with “crypto”. Bitcoin is decentralized revolutionary programable money. The Lightning layer allows for payments faster than Visa & allows for financial inclusion for people outside on the rails that you as an American are lucky enough to have. What about the rest of the world?. Check your financial privilege! 

The utility of Bitcoin is the problem it solves with monetary debasement. Aka (Price Inflation).  & All the 3rd party trust required.

Ryan,"So I sat through this video and didn't see you go over what Blockchain and crypto was initially even created to solve and do... The main purpose was to remove the need for an intermediary trust (banks), but still have a trusted ledger of transactions, total assets etc. Right now we are at the mercy of a few elite families and people who run the banks. Because of them the economy tanks, or businesses fail. They control it all. Now, we have other Blockchains that are here to solve cross border payments. So right now it takes up to a week to move money from USD to Pesos. With crypto, this can happen in seconds. Not to mention there would be no need for banks to hold excessive amounts of USD in order to complete these transactions. I could go on, but all you did was scratch the surface and cherry pick your argument against it. 
Now let's get to ""you only make money because you sell to others who lose"". Wow, that sounds like EVERY OTHER MARKET. Real estate, stocks, Forex? I mean c'mon. Maybe interview some actual Blockchain experts instead of some biased influencers.",2023-02-13T21:23:52Z

Cam Fuzzy,"""Bitcoin has no inherent value"".......you are correct.  However, neither does....gold....or a Picasso......or that $10 bill in your pocket.  Cryptocurrency vs stocks vs gold.....what makes it valuable? What makes it valuable is what people are willing to pay for it or what a society perceives its value is.  Wheat, nothing says that a plant has ANY intrinsic monetary value.  However, if one person feels they have a greater need for it than whatever that person has on them that other people see as valuable, they will give that up to get the wheat.  If the person across the street is hungrier though, they may offer something that has a value more than the first person...all of the sudden the ""wheat"" is valuable.  So, the person across the street hands the vendor his $100 bill....that vendor just traded something that is needed to sustain life for a small piece of paper.  That small piece of paper has as much use cases as Bitcoin does, society just perceives that it differently, literally....that is it....end of story.  Difference is one is the government saying ""trust us, that useless piece of paper has value"" while the other is as valuable as a population is willing to back it.  Crypto, yep, tons of scams...just like anything involving large amounts of currency in a new fledgling development.  But, what it ALL comes down to....wanna know why an NFT is worth so much?....cause someone was willing to pay that much for it. Wanna know why a physical piece of art is worth so much?.....cause someone is willing to pay that much for it. That painting is, literally, absolutely worthless in the grand scheme of things. You cannot eat, you cannot drink it, it does not provide you with shelter, it does not carry out a specific job that benefits society....it is absolutely no different than an NFT, except you can carry your NFT around in your pocket, while the portrait  you paid 37 million dollars for, sits on a wall....doing absolutely nothing and having absolutely zero value....unless someone else is willing to pay you for that piece of parchment stuck to your wall that does nothing to sustain you.  All money is a giant Ponzi scheme or a giant con.....I just know if I was on a stranded Island, a barrel of water and a crate of food would have a much higher value than a crate of green paper with portraits of dead government offials stamped onto it.",2023-02-13T01:38:08Z

My bank has stopped me from sending my own money from my account to an exchange on the pretext of “protecting” me. That’s BS, what they and others are trying to do is stop their avenue of wealth from deteriorating. 

There are thousands of crypto tokens / coins and many are rubbish/scams, but not all, and there is a very good user case for some. 

Let’s not forget, that when the internet was born many questioned the reason for it and concluded that it was only for porn, drugs and money laundering. Now the same excuses are being levied at crypto!

The other angle you overlook is bitcoin’s energy use as a catalyst for the renewable energy transition. Consider btc mining and methane capture or making solar or wind farms more profitable. Any stranded energy is useful for bitcoin mining.

And of corse now buing NFT is stupid. It is promoted by cryptomilioners who earn a lot on crypto. Now they just want to make people be interested in technology on NFT. It is not good that financial HYPE on crypto make prices so high, but it is how it get promoted so fast... When the Hype someday will go away, who is smart will  stay with cypto and I hope that he will have his day. I think that it will be like with Internet Bubble... Nasdaq get high and then get low for years and now they ae higher then before. The same wil be with crypto

The technology is great and already managed to put people in control by storing value in a permissionless way. Anything that could go wrong went wrong because of greedy people, nonetheless, the technology is there and has been improving, if you have eyes to see. Like every technology needs to be tested. 
Scammers have been around since the beginning of time, crypto just gave them a faster and better tool but there are teams and company that want to create value. The focus is just on dumb NFT and greedy company that, YES, want fuck people and make money. This show the real nature of human being overall, not in the specific case.

Marek Nipca,"I agree with 90 percent of  otherwise great video. I have a few comments about the Bitcoin section. As for the problem with the deflationary nature of Bitcoin. Before the Bretton Woods system was abolished, all currencies were inherently deflationary and this was not a problem. People knew that it pays to save, and by moving their consumption into the future, they created reserves for future economic growth. So, thanks to Bitcoin, we are going back to real sound money. The energy demand of Bitcoin is not a problem if we consider that the cost of running an ordinary average bank is much higher. In addition, Bitcoin enables better management of electricity consumption, which fluctuates and rises throughout the day. Thanks to Bitcoin, excess energy in low traffic can be used to validate transactions in its network.",2023-02-12T12:09:17Z

It was like a group of people already trying to teach and breed children to think crypto . My crazy conspiracy this joint got me thinking like damn what if they were tryna influence us when we were young to make money of us later as a short term Investment and that’s why we see this generation move the way it does. 🥸🧐",2023-02-12T04:50:02Z
Interesting Times,"When I first started watching, I was thinking ""this guy probably doesn't understand why bitcoin has such a revolutionary concept, but all the other coins and nft's are clearly a scam, but if he really understood how the banks and financial system worked and how bitcoin worked, he wouldn't be calling it a scam"" and about 30 minutes in, I am starting to see how even though I do not believe bitcoin was created with the intent to become a scam, but thats what it became due to the nature of how people interpreted and adopted it. The sad thing is that the financial system is still extremely corrupt and leaving the vast majority of people vulnerable to negligence or even intentional harm. Something like bitcoin, combined with different networks like litecoin or others, make it scalable to fulfill the need for a decentralized, incorruptible system, but the truth is that the whole crypto ecosystem has become corrupted via the interpretation and the behavior that is now associated with it. The hope is that some kind of decentralized currency can be formed, but it would likely have the same tech behind it to make it work (hence, bitcoin looking so attractive). Unfortunately, the central powers will likely create a CBDC before that happens and then they will have even more ability to control the financial system to corrupt it in their interests and have more tools to control society. Tbh, I still have hope that bitcoin will become what it was intended, when regular life becomes more controlled and less free. It is the currency of the black market, so it will not shine like the big believers hope it will until everything that we enjoy about contemporary life becomes part of the black market, and we will have to use it to have the things we do now. But really I just hope that it never actually gets to that point. Im just glad that we have some form of infrastructure to facilitate a way around a future with an extreme form of corruption and manipulation of the masses, if that does ever happen.

Stefan müller,"i think James must have been scammed with Bitcoin earlier and unloads all his anger. His depiction lacks of core fundamental on Bitcoin, especially 2nd layer. How can you talk about small first layer block size being too small with fractional transactions per second compared to visa and Mastercard. Do your job and educate before publishing. Bitcoin lightning has transaction capacity of more than 1.2 mil per seconds and hence way larger than visa and mastercard combined. Lightning network growing exponential. Such a one sided negative view on Bitcoin without any positives at all is just embarrassing. Bitcoin is designed to be a store of value not a currency though its monetary policy is better than any fiat currency existing. Fiat is about trust only, btc as well but based on math and the most secure protocol network human race has ever seen. Superior technology requires energy thats a law of nature. James puts nft, crypto scams and eth into one basket with Bitcoin proofs his lack of fundamental knowledge. Transferring digital property around the world at the speed of light is just revolutionary. No any other energy consuming technology can be used better with renewables than Bitcoin. Tons of daily wire transactions facing problems with intermediaries where no problems at all suppose to occur. Bitcoin will eat all of it. Hard money always beats soft money, period.

I see Bitcoin however as digital property, and I feel like the courts so far have agreed.  After reading about the Weimar republic and their hyperinflation I thought real estate was really the best thing to preserve wealth but I've started to diversify away a bit into things like gold, silver, bitcoin, and other types of commodities as now I'm somewhat thinking it's hard to take my real estate with me if something were to happen.

I live in a country where making international transactions is a hassle, and the government constantly tries to lock citizens out of international commerce, stable coins have been the best way out for most citizens and this is because they exist on the blockchain that the government has no power over.

TruSam,"I agree with the scepticism about NFTs and ICOs. But calling the whole Crypto space „scam“ is a bit far fetched. Bitcoin for example has its problems and negativ aspect like the huge energy consumption. But so has the monetary system, which more so deserved being called “scam”. At the end of the day there is nothing that has intrinsic value. Every value is perceived value. If everyone tomorrow would decide that dollar, bitcoin or gold is worthless, well then it would be worthless. Same goes for NFTs, even tough I don’t see any value in them too. But that is just me. 

I think the problem lies in us humans, trying to get rich quick. It may work, most likely it wont. But if you for example trust bitcoin or gold as a store of value, because you researched the topic and history of other currencies and money, and your expectation is to at least outplay inflation: i think is a completely different story, which wasn’t even mentioned in this video. You made it highly polarising, and I which you would have shed light to all the different aspects of crypto and it’s use cases. Not just a few. Or at least wouldn’t call the whole crypto space “scam” when you only talk about a few aspects.
We definitely need an alternative monetary system that is not controlled by centralised entities to store whatever we traded our time and work for in and not have it stolen by war, gambling of big banks etc.",2023-02-08T08:25:25Z

This is a kindergarten level of information video. You didn’t even cover some of the real bad potential of crypto- CBDCs for example and how all centralized banks and governments want them to be implemented worldwide. See, your audience doesn’t even know about this kind of stuff, because you were so focused on the “scam” narrative. You also completely leave out some of the actual innovations technology wise that has happened. People just think it’s only money. That’s selling short what the technology actually does. Your video will likely convince others that’s what it’s all about. You don’t have to like crypto, but you should have brought a more complete and balanced perspective. This video clearly is not that, though you might want to think otherwise. It presents only a small pipiece of the picture. Sadly, this video will be the beginning and end of some of your audience’s knowledge journey. They will move on while the war for technology and the financial system continues unnoticed by them.

chiliplayer,"Well .. when going into detail, then FIAT Money is clearly the winner in being the worlds greatest scam. And scam is everywhere, you don't even need to look to crypto. The bigger question is, what we get in exchange.
For the first time in almost all human history, we are finally able to take of the shackles of our leaderships and head into self-determination. Have you looked at inflation for the past months? This is solely the fault of those leaderships and bad decisions.
So - is crypto perfect? No. But neither ist Fiat. Neither is Gold. Nothing is. All we can look at is the things we gain in exchange for things we lose - and under that perspective, crypto (or something equivalent) is the only thing the future can go.
Fiat Money is a giant Ponzy which is doomed to fail - once you understand how Fiat actually works, you know it. It seems, what you really criticize is the market itself and the people participating in it. NFT is the best example. It's market. It would've never happened if there weren't people(!) participating in it. And here again - the business behind NFTs is the same business as there is behind art - the normal dayjobber doesn't even has the slightest idea about what goes on behind the curtains there. Only with art ""normal people"" just cant participate, so noone cares",2023-02-06T22:52:55Z
Stefano Murcia,"This content was good in pointing out the scam scheme that original Bitcoin purists have pointed out since the beginning. To unpack the statement above, we have to make an attempt to understand the original Bitcoin protocol and the path it was intended to follow. I am of the understanding that BTC the way we know it today is not the original protocol. The original code still exists, has been updated to allow for the original vision, and continues to stress that everything presented in this video is true.

Where I would like you all to do your due diligence in is in the attempt to understand what happened ahead of BTC forking to Bitcoin Cash and then again to Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV).

N,"You aren't describing ""Crypto"". You are mostly describing the scams in crypto. You could say the same thing about the internet and all the scams running on the internet. You are also mostly focussing on the money part, which is totally irrelevant. It's the same as talking about Facebook and only think about the stock price, it's not what it's about! It's about the tech. You think the world is only the USA, but there is more in the world where decentralized networks are a big solution. Even some governments are using it. Also a lot of big companies are using it, and that's why it's possible you have used crypto or NFT's without even knowing it. I actually find out a couple of weeks ago I used a NFT ticket without knowing it. It was from a party a couple of years a go and it was just a normal ticket, but with the information stored on the blockchain. It was from Guts Tickets and they used GET Protocol. The user won't even notice it. But it's also used in cars for example, like Alfa Romeo is using it in their cars. But there are a lot of other examples and use cases, and a lot of companies are already using it. So please, get your facts straight. It's not just all scams.",2023-02-04T15:52:06Z

Life is Short,"Watched the whole thing and am disappointed. Bitcoin was created to solve a problem, quite well, actually. To claim it's a ponzi is ridiculous. Gold is seen as a safe haven against inflation and goes up because people believe it will go up in price over time. Same goes for stocks and many other things too. Social security and pensions are by definition ponzi schemes. They do require future participants to enter to pay the previous ones yet you ignorantly bash attempts at solving a global fiat money printing system designed to steal your labor and wealth through debasement. You, sir, are masterful at sharing your myopic views. Thanks",2023-02-04T13:54:23Z

An entirely new economy just terraformed finance like a genesis bomb.

Andrew Schneider,"Very well done. I think much of crypto gets a well deserved bad rap. That said, the base use case of crypto is to simply relace USD as the global reserve asset, which is currently valued at hundreds of trillions of dollars. Our current fiat money has major, major flaws: It's forced upon people, it can only become more inflationary over time, and has very limited transparency to the very people is it meant to serve. All of these limitations with fiat can be solved by blockchain based money. Additionally, I think the critique of web 3 here is missing the potential pros that could result from all this. There are actually very real and very valuable use cases that will be enabled through transparent guarantees and ownership of assets that blockchains can enable.

In terms what you said about nfts i feel like you're sort of missing the point about the technology, while the first application was digital art and the craze was fairly stupid, digital ownership is what we're rlly getting out of this. you can now have proof of your ownership for whatever thing you own digitally, tht would be small things like music tickets or could be large things like the deed of your house (the beauty of this is you have access to who else owned your house and for how long). if you want i'd love to chat about this",2023-02-03T19:19:07Z

Mustafa Dağ,"I do think that you are 99% right. There is a BUT coming :). Firstly, most of the projects are absolutely scam. As you mentioned before to make some cash. But Web 3.0 is not just a myth. Think about it. All the data you have right now, where do you keep it? As an example, I guess you keep most of your passwords on Google Passwords and you do not even remember most of them. I know companies like Google and Microsoft are reliable but can you guarantee that you can trust them forever? Just assume that one of your mails have been modified without your consent. Can you prove that you haven't send that mail? Absolutely NO. Why? Because the mail is kept in Google/Microsoft or whichever service providers you have used databases. Hence they can modify it without your consent and you have no way to prove that they did modify it. I know this is a bit forced but is it really that much impossible? You can think other scenarios too. But in these blockchains, the code is open source for most of them. If you do understand coding you can just go and check whether they keep your data behind the scenes. You own your data because the blockchain systems do not run in one centralised server. In PoW it works on all the miners computers. In PoS it runs on all validators which are in most cases permissionless meaning everyone can be a validator as long as he owns some ""shares"" of that project. As long as less than a percentage of validators are malicious, majority can detect the action and prevent it and punish them. In PoW the punishment is waste of energy spent on Work part. In PoS, it is the ""shares"". They slice your shares according to ruleset which are determined while deploying code in other words when the blockchain started to operate. Hence, although you do not lose your ""reputation"" like right now, you loss money if you are malicious. This is why it is called ""Trustless"". You do not need to trust anyone. You only need to trust/understand code. If somebody tries to act smart, the code will punish him accordingly. It was quite a long writing, but I hope people who read can understand what Web 3.0 is about. As I mentioned at the start you are 99% right but this technology is not as trash as you mentioned :).

Drupe pong,"Here's a question that I have for the people who believe in crypto and the decentralised currency thing. 
Basically a group of people coming together creating something new that they all believe has value, and a tech that can be used to confirm and keep a record of all transactions. 
You don't want to believe in the centralised money. But if you don't want to believe in the centralised money, why should the state/center regulate your space for you? If it does start regulating then wouldn't it just become similar to centralised money again? The very thing that you were trying to avoid?

I think in any form of money, you could always have bad actors and people with power. 
What happens when they misuse this power?
You can check their transactions and you can even prove that they acted fraudulently.
But what next? without also having access to a centralised means of coercion/force, you cannot get them to change or do anything.

So a decentralised money exchange also means you don't have access to the centralised means of coercion. 
You can't gain full freedom from state regulation but also want to have it when things go wrong.

With that being said, I think the best way we can go about this is to make the centralised money/coercion system as democratic as possible. 
One thing that stands in between us doing this is the present form of Capitalism.",2023-02-03T04:05:01Z

James Brown,"Gonna have to disagree with the conclusion, along with a lot of the assumptions made along the way, particularly regarding Bitcoin.  To say that it 's only a Ponzi Scheme is to imply that it has no value aside from people trying to make more money on it (which is apparently Jame's conclusion), which really isn't the case.  

People see value in a digital asset that can't be frozen or seized at will by an outside entity (government or otherwise), particularly in countries like North Korea, wherein the leaders have implemented all types of draconian laws regarding how everyone's ""own"" money (their country's fiat currency) can be spent.  And I don't think I need to point out the cons of an inflationary currency like those used by nations around the word.  We can all look to the rising prices of food and about everything else, to the tune of about 8% in one year, in the US (that's nearly an 8% loss of purchasing power in one year's time!), and MUCH worse in other countries.

To simply gloss over real value propositions like this have me wondering just how much actual research went into making this documentary.  It certainly isn't unbiased in how it's presented, at the very least.

Also, to act like 13 years is long enough to close the book on an emerging tech simply demonstrates naivety in how the adoption of new tech generally works.  The Internet was around for a LOT longer than 13 years before your average person considered it a mainstay and/or a valuable technology.

Jiří Šebek,"NO HATE, but from your commentary it's clear that you don't really understand the PoW cryptocurrency, or WEB 3.0 itself and how things work in terms of safety.
You just don't understand how big Web 3.0 can be, but it still has a long way to go and no one knows what the real uses and all the security benefits will be. 

The funny thing is that you say it's not appropriate to trust code, yet you run a banking system that also depends on someone else's code, particularly easy to attack and rob. If selling bitcoin in profit is a scam, then whole stock market trading is a scam / ponzi scheme :D You are right that there is a disgusting amount of scammers and frauds in the cryptos, especially the NFT wave.
But from a technology perspective, it all makes sense, but governments are unlikely to give up the power they have through control of fiat finance, so it's unlikely or any other cryptocurrency should or will replace ""money"". Most likely they will create their own digital currency instead with some particular functions. 


The biggest problem with the whole video is that you refer to the entire crypto as a scam, even though you only point to NFT scams. 
It's like saying that the banking system is the biggest scam in the world because the bank I had money with went bankrupt and won't pay out all my funds, because every bank is contractually obligated to pay out only 10% of your total savings. But that's not true, it's just that I chose the wrong bank. My own decision, and what could have influenced me? 
Ads, recommendations, previous experience, references, exactly the same as with any crypto project. 

Cryptocurrencies are at an early stage and the only reason why BTC is constantly increasing in price is because the amount of it is not increasing, but the ""real"" money is constantly being printed => thus devaluing. I am not an advocate of either extreme view. I'm a simple realist... 

Market trading (stocks / cc / etc.) is about buying cheap and selling expensive. It's all about timing. For example...How long were electric cars built before they went into mass production? 
Do you think it's easy with such massively used software to avoid all the problems and create error-free code that is completely unbreakable? It is still in the phase of developing and most probably will be for a loooong time. Even NFT can have some kind of usage as a technology, but people are just stupid. 

Luckily for me, in 6 years of investing in cryptocurrencies, I've only gotten burned once on TERRA LUNA. The only reason I sell cryptocurrencies is so I can buy more for the same amount, just like I do in the stock market. They follow the same trading rules, paterns and global economic situation.
The only reason there are so many cryptocurrency scams is because people are too stupid and lazy to study the project they are investing in. Everything is super complicated, so they believe what sounds good to them, but if they trust everyone, especially influencers like Logan Paul, then they most likely deserve such a lesson.



I would sum it up by saying that it is a unique and great debatable technology that may have great uses, but no one knows if it will really be used and in what form. 
Before investing, you need to study everything thoroughly and decide if it all makes sense as with everything else. Cheers",2023-02-02T23:04:35Z

The only difference right now is that banks have a much bigger pool of liquidity to play with. So yeah, crypto has its thing but you Should also educate people how money works and how banks work.

Crypto itself has not had much inovation to the world but the development of block chain tools and programs has shown the many possibilities of a decentralized utilities for real world events and tests, I could name 10 or even 100, but i'll leave it up to whoever reads this to decide if they are in fact worth the conspiracies of a simple digital token.",2023-02-02T17:16:56Z

Oliver Glendenning,"I like this video, as it highlights some of the dangers involved in speculative investments that I've faced in the cryptocurrency space that have zero utility.  

However consider that the central banks are making their own central bank digital currencies based on block chain technology because many cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is on a public ledger making transfers more transparent. 

I originally didn't see the point of NFTs now I see them adding utility to a business and value to brand ambassadors. Consider you buy and online ticket then it's gone imagine tokenising that ticket and creating value  also helps the environment compared to paper ticketing. It's also  been  proposed to tokenise  property like title deeds etc and other things.

Another big benefit of crypto currency in my Opinion  its quicker to transfer at a fraction of a penny compared to banks, literally some people have sent $hundreds of thousands abroad for cents on the dollar and some of these money transfer cryptos are able to process tens of thousands of transactions per second.  There's plenty of Ponzi schemes in cryptocurrency undeniably but we can't rely on at system that endlessly prints money, every currency in the world on a long enough time line goes to zero and becomes super inflationery.",2023-02-02T10:45:00Z

Why don't you say that you can't do SWIFT transfer during a weekend and guess what Bitcoin can do THAT and way cheaper too! Btw bitcoin primary goal is to be a digital gold as a store of value not as a currency, Bitcoin has limited supply and not like the dollar that is being printed and lose it's value every day because of the inflation. There are other cryptos that can do better when it comes to being a currency with 10x the speed of visa and masterCard, american express, etc.
There are bad actors in every industry but you simply can't deny that Bitcoin and crypto in general is already proven to provide a lot of value and every year more and more apps will transition to blockchain, also the number of users keep increasing every year. People are slowly realizing the potential and the value it brings, It will come a day where every company and every pension fund will own some portion in crypto.

One area that was left out are macroeconomic realities. For example, the excessive increase in global government debt, which can lead to defaulting states. This is one actual reason to have globally decentralized currency. For example, Argentina defaulted on its debt in 2001, 2014, and was on the edge in 2019/2020. Ask folks from there how their savings fared vs. BTC in those years.

Rebecca W,"So I agree with this entirely and I have been in crypto space since 2018. One thing I wonder though, is what about the countries that are adopting Bitcoin as their official currency which I know one is El Salvador, then there was the Central Africa Republic but I heard they switched and banned it so not sure, and I heard about Venezuela but not sure. On the other side of that coin is the counties that have banned crypto, which are many. Does the counties who ban it seem smart like they don’t want their country or their people to lose all their wealth in a scam (when the volcano explodes), or are the countries that made it legal smart? I got out cause all the regulations at tax time, why trade crypto with a nightmare at tax time when you can just trade with a broker that automatically gives you a form. Or even a prop firm. Plus why on earth would I use crypto on a Visa card to make everyday purchases when the SEC declared every sale of crypto is a taxable transaction, I was waiting for you to mention that, but I guess you were too busy talking about the bigger picture. Really though how Bitcoin could never be a currency now. I know people in the space say when one Bitcoin is worth 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 million  then the value of it will stabilize so people will transact with it, even if it was a stablecoin, it’s still a taxable transaction. Not to mention too that the military is developing a super computer and when that thing is capable of hacking the blockchain all crypto will be history!",2023-02-02T08:47:48Z

Yes, there's a lot of horrendous scamming using crypto currencies but that doesn't make the technology itself a scam. There are lots of ponzi schemes using fiat currency too, and that's also not the fault of fiat currencies.
There's absolutely nothing in crypto that inherently makes it a ponzi scheme.
What crypto/blockchain enables is a secure way to do online transactions without a middleman. That is in itself a clear use case that has clear value. 
Yes, that also makes it attractive to scammers and other criminals, but guess what: scammers are gonna scam and criminals are gonna crime no matter what, it's a different problem. 
One could outlaw crypto outright, but that wouldn't solve any crime (and it wouldn't actually even be the reason to outlaw it).


Of course NFTs of pictures of bored apes and other Trumps-depicted-as-superheroes pics are cringy as f*ck. I can easily waste my money on similar stupidity without getting near crypto technology too.

While it's important to be cautious when considering an investment in cryptocurrency, it's not accurate to dismiss the entire industry as a scam.

Mateusz Borczyk,"Let's assume that cryptocurrencies are a scam, a ponzi scheme, and it is certain that their value will fall dramatically. Therefore, it is logical that you should short them. But if so, and a lot of people will short them, it means that they are obliged to buy them back in the future. And this will make their value rise again! 
My conclusion is that cryptocurrencies value will never fall totally just because they can be shorted! Unlike other ponzi schemes which cannot be shorted. 
In my opinion, this is a gap in logic that most people do not realize! You can make money on dips as well as rises, that is why cryptocurrencies will never collapse! Just because of the ability to make money on dips. Come to think of it, I believe it is possible to create a mathematical model that confirms my reasoning. Futures will save cryptocurrencies as long as you can make money on dips. Without contracts - agree, perhaps the value of cryptocurrencies will collapse.",2023-02-01T15:36:02Z

Scott Vermast,"first of all, 60% of the video you are talking about nfts.. 
people are dumb and buy in to stuff because others do, thats just how humans work.. 
if you think its crazy people pay millions for a digital signature on a random meme picture, you are completely right.. 
but thats just how the art world works in general.. if you pay millions for a painting you are the same amount of crazy imo.. 
nfts got overhyped, just like anything can really.. and people just buy it because its ""cool"". its not a scam.. 
if you buy in late or that specific hype is over, thats on you..

second, you talk about bitcoin being used as the global currency.. 
nakamoto had a vision and yes that was the first premise.. but just like anything in this world, things evolve.. 
people create newer and better things, things that are more efficient, easier to use etc.. 
bitcoin was revolutionary, and yes its true, people that are in from the start benefit the most.. 
just like anything in the investing world.. that doesnt mean that it is a ponzi scheme.. 
people build on the idea of decentralizing and automating real world problems into a computer program that keeps running and cant be stopped by anyone! 
yes, 95% of the crypto projects dont really have utlity and are just hype and thats possible because its decentralized.. 
and yes, shady stuff is happening every day just like in our current financial system.. 
but i really do believe the other 5% is working on technologies that a lot of people just cant get their grasp on yet.. 

people tend to invest in crypto when everything is going up, cause thats when you see everyone talking about it in social media etc.. 
which means most people buy in late to the party.. which in turn makes people lose money and call it a scam.. 
while others sit on massive profits cause they stick around during the hard times.. investing 101.. 
i might be completely wrong, and crypto might be the biggest ponzi scheme of all time.. 
but think about the potential it has.. 
we are not just gonna be using crypto for sending money accross the globe, we are creating and automating solutions for real world problems and if people cant see that yet, i get it.. 
but most of us cant even imagine what this technology is gonna be used for in the future, including me.. 
it might be a bumpy road but i'd stick around cause what if the critics are wrong.. crypto is still so new and is slowly entering our world, adaption is inevitable imo, its just getting started. :)",2023-02-01T14:12:38Z

marvin maali,"I was expecting great stuff only until he said a deflationary currency is not good for running a global economy.
Look, it is simple.
A deflationary currency looks bad because it will (also) be held for it's mere value increase tomorrow. Fair enough. But at the margin, people still have to buy food, water, and other necessities. 
So it doesn't matter if it is so scarse it will double in value every other day. Still, one has to let some of it go  so as to buy food.
Now, when it goes up in value because the economy is actually growing, I think that is a good thing. Everything else gets cheaper, abundance can be felt.
Contrast with an inflationary money system that robs people of their wealth by leadin to either price increase in goods so that the avergae perosn can no longer afford them, or a deflation in the size of goods (scarcity of wealth instead of abundance) and you know the inflationary money is worse.

If Your asking, in what context have you been framed to buy bitcoin.. Well That depends on your everyday living situation.. If you live in the US where everything is a the tip of your finger then sure Bitcoin is a speculative asset and has no use case.. 

But if your in Kiev, Ukraine and are trying to get your wealth out of the country, Bitcoin is your best option.. All you need to do is remember 12 words... Unless you want to cross the Polish border caring a bag of cash or a suitcase of Gold..  You have this opinion about crypto because you have no use for it currently..

Soon you will be forced to use blockchain technology and NFTs will be in your everyday life... Your I.D., House Dead, Car Title will all one day be represented by a NFT... All a NFT is, is a way prove ownership on the blockchain.

Also you say Bitcoin is a decentralized Ponzi scheme.. Bitcoin was created with no price attached to it.. The first use of Bitcoin as a currency was when someone used it to buy Pizza..

Transcendent,"I doubt my voice will be heard in an ocean of sceptics, but here goes my 2 cents. I mean this to be constructive criticism and hope it doesn't fall on deaf ears. 
While I agree with you on everything you say about NFTs, scamcoins, ICO mania, and the likes of it, I do not agree with what you say on bitcoin and how you put it in the same bag. Some of your points are lies, some are lies by omission but lies nonetheless, and it obfuscates the truth, quite the opposite of what you'd be trying to achieve with an educational documentary. I'm worried that this information will go as the ""truth"" on bitcoin, however I view the truth to be a process rather than a state so I hope my input will steer at least some people towards it.

- You mention that bitcoin ""wastes"" (instead of ""uses"" for example) energy without mentioning the fact that it is the MOST secure network on earth. Bitcoin being a financial network, that is a pretty import fact.

- Bitcoin indeed has only 7 transactions per second, but those transactions are final (i.e. can not be modified, ever), so you can not compare it to VISA where transactions can be rolled back even days after. Let's take the tx/s argument anyway: you make no mention of the lightning network which is EXPONENTIALLY (it can process millions of transactions already) faster than VISA and the likes and is just as secure as bitcoin because it is built on top of it.

- The big talking point of bitcoin being a Ponzi because ""to make money on it, someone has to lose it"", if you think about it, that is how a market simply works. Take gold, silver, any other precious metal that is also traded speculatively, take even stocks, they work on the same principle, yet they're not called Ponzi schemes. The price in a market goes higher because of 2 things: (new) people buying and inflation.

- You liken Satoshi to Madoff, while not said explicitly, it is implied and is a manipulation tactic to tarnish Satoshi's and bitcoin's reputation but since you are convinced that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme I can see where you are coming from. Either way, the comparison is not honest on another front: Satoshi made bitcoin and just vanished and never, ever, mentioned that it will make you rich. He hoped that his invention might help humanity after seeing the corruption of the financial system, that's a lot more humble than what you make it out to be. Madoff was a criminal running his Ponzi and promising returns until the end, it doesn't fit you see?

- You say that bitcoin is a failed revolution while ignoring how much people in South America and Africa are starting to use it. It is not obvious for people living in Western countries where the currencies are relatively stable but in countries where the currency is a lot less stable, using bitcoin is already making sense. Yet you assert multiple times that it has no real use cases. What do you say to those people, that have no real alternative because of inexistant banking system, corrupt government and/or unstable currency? Is their POSITIVE opinion on bitcoin insignificant or worth less than yours?
You declare bitcoin a failed revolution while it has existed only for 14 years. For comparison, the internet started in 1983, by the same logic you'd declare it a failed tech in the dot com crash in 2000 (17 years after inception), now look how much it has changed everything. It started to really accelerate in 2010, almost 30 years after creation. I think you see why calling bitcoin a fail is hasty conclusion.

- You mention the Winklevoss twins, and how these two well-educated folks started stockpiling bitcoin, what is the issue of highly educated people realising that bitcoin is something great? If anything, you'd expect more educated individuals to understand why bitcoin is useful, how it works and why it will catch on. However, I do agree that the likes of Blackrock now investing in it is not ideal and doesn't make me ecstatic because of all the history of big banks/ asset managers manipulation markets, but oh well, it was bound to happen at some point.

- Finally, we invest in bitcoin because number go up, yes, as with any investment, but that is not the sole reason. We, bitcoiners, believe that bitcoin is something that can truly free us from the government-owned currencies, we have had enough of the corruption of the government and hope that bitcoin will be the separation of state and money the same way we had separation from church and state. The greed will always be present, even in the most idealistic communities, but the greediest people in crypto have moved on from bitcoin to some scams likes NFTs, scam coins etc. Therefore, today, there are a lot more people buying it for idealistic reasons than because of greed. Will we still buy low and sell high to acquire more bitcoin? Of course, as any logical individual would do in a market, but greed is not our guiding force because of it.

To conclude, I think that the part on bitcoin was intellectually unhonest as is evidently implied by my lengthy comment on such a small fraction of the video. However, the video is very well made, easy to follow, exposes what needs to exposed, so good job for that. With great following comes great responsibility, so be careful what you say and how you say it.",2023-01-31T11:15:28Z

I'd mostly consider myself a bitcoin maximalist these days so agree most cryptos are scams., but it might have been more balanced if you'd talked about some of the problems with current monetary system, especially inflation and money printing and the ways bitcoin can solve those issues. The use case pushed for bitcoin now is not so much as a currency but as a store of value, hence the term ""digital gold"". Might also have been worth talking about the lightning network which does allow bitcoin to be used more like a currency for small, fast transactions.

Also, a mention of CBDC's could have been a good idea. That is, Central Bank Digital Currencies - basically a government run cryptocurrency. There's a lot of talk about governments sneaking these into use in their path to cashless societies. If governments do take control of your cash away from you like this, then bitcoin becomes an even more attractive alternative!",2023-01-31T10:00:34Z

Have some critical thinking. Like the stock market is a fair game... Ridiculous,2023-01-31T04:34:40Z

Bitcoin has not failed... the most secure network on the planet - still going.. and yet you say that it failed. Nobody and no government can stop it. nobody and no government can stop one peer from transacting with another. the number go up and only a side effect of a deflationary asset.

UIM Loki,"I watched this as someone who is heavily interested in bitcoin, not crypto, as I’m constantly trying to poke holes in the bitcoin narrative, as anyone with conviction in anything should do.

I agree that every clone of bitcoin, which are often referred to as alt coins, are indeed scams. However, I don’t see bitcoin as a scam at all. 

It wouldn’t be productive to refute every point you made about bitcoin in a YouTube comment, however I will say that you did a poor job outlining satoshi’s vision of what bitcoin is. You mentioned it’s deflationary, which it is, and that in terms of being a currency, being deflationary is bad because “why would you want to spend something that’s going to go up in value?” 

First of all, bitcoin is not simply a currency. The concept of a currency is something that can be applied to most anything. For example, in prisons cigarettes are a currency, in kindergarten, Pokémon cards are a currency, etc. bitcoin is useable as a currency, but a more apt name would be “digitized energy”. You can convert physical joules into a scarce digital asset through thermodynamics. That is the real innovation of bitcoin, that is proof of work. 

Secondly, everyone has sold something that would’ve gone up in value if they hadn’t sold in, in order to buy something in the present. Stocks, property, art, commodities such as gold and silver, collectibles, etc. 

I wish you went into more specifics on the claims you made, but had you done that the title of the video would end up being the opposite.",2023-01-31T02:42:33Z

Zeap,"Valid points but super flawed video. As someone who knows ALOT about cryptocurrencies I see your point. However you didn’t mention many things that allow crypto to have a huge edge over traditional financial systems. To make a more unbiased video giving details about decentralized finance (DeFi), one of cryptos greatest assets, would only be right. DeFi and blockchain is so great in fact that governments are rolling out their own digital currencies (ofc not decentralized) because they see the huge uses and values this technology has. This video it quite flawed because you only mentioned the parts in crypto that were a scam, it’s like saying McDonald’s is a salad restaurant because they have a lot of salad options, simply not fair.

codfish.,Isn't the you make money when someone else lost money element present in all capitalist exchanges? The problem is that the so called hard currencies are being controlled by fraudsters who just make more to fix their short term issues. Fiat currency will eventually become worthless and you can already see governments trying to make their own digital currencies but it ends up failing as well because it is centralized. If all the world power is held by a small corrupt contingent it will eventually lead to disaster. I love how you made this video but unlike most of your videos u don't remain impartial and u reinforce your dislikes for the crypto space.

bla ba,"09:40 you should use your money on the things you need, not throw it away on bullshit out of fear it not holding its value.
the idea of our hard earned money value being slowly eroded be presented as a good thing is insane to me, how can we save value for later in life? how can we pass it on to our children without gambling it away in the stock market? whats the point of money if its value is not kept?
if you build an economy built on stuff people dont really need, dont be surprised to find it wasteful and controlled by consumerism 

10:01 bitcoin is not going to replace visa, it will be the method by which you keep the value of your earnings, once you want to spend it, you can transact some of it to the less trustworthy currency and make as many transaction as you want with vise or whatever 

10:58 what is the sum total of bank energy consumption around the world? servers, real world working people, driving to workplaces, branches, programmers, fraud detection, regulation, is that free of energy use? no, a stable financial system comes with a cost, this is not new.

10:18 to talk about bernie madoff right after talking about bitcoin is kinda manipulative, unlike banks, people control the bitcoin in their wallets, where if too many people will ask the banks for the money they have placed there, the banks will say ""sorry we dont have it"" just the same as in the case of Madoff, the real ponzy is in the banks who dont really hold and safeguard your money, the play with it, gamble with it, yes, they are mostly transparent about it, but the fact is that the money you placed in the bank is not really there, just like madoff

13:30 some people buy bitcoin as an investment, some as a hedge against fiat currency, some as a store of value,  none of it really changes what bitcoin is.

14:20 no, that is not the only way for bitcoin to get more valuable, printing money also strengthens bitcoin for example, currency collapse is not a new phenomena, governments can be irresponsible and we have ample examples in the past. 

16:25 dunking on 'the nerd' for being invested in something is a bully move, trying to undermine the credibility of some one for liking world of warcraft is pretty cheap, did you check what other people in powerful positions like video games? lawyers, judges,  politicians, bankers, leading tech and scientists

im a bit tired and honestly doubt many people are going to read this so im not going to continue,  but there is to say, 'crypto' has its flaws, it is far from being a perfect system and it is definitely far for maturity, there are thousands of fraudsters out there, you should be extra careful and doubtful, most coins will crash at some point, but the big ones will probably last forever and out live the dollar, and thats the point, with all of the flaws in bitcoin, it should be compared to the alternative, a government, maybe not even your government who can freely print itself currency which is equivalent to stealing from you, banks that dont really hold of the money you have given them, and state laws that allow some organization to take your money from you.

They are money making scams where the early investors make out like bandits. 
Show me an asset backed currency that just keeps its value and I would be interested. 
Government currencies are schemes too, Governments steal from the increases caused by inflationary money printing and tax the increase as profit when the increase is from money devaluation. This is double stealing. 
On  top of the inflation scam, there is the  banking schemes which lend money that does not exist. This steals most of the potential of real earned money. Some  humans just can't help themselves. They steak  and scam whenever they can, and make laws to defend and further their stealing. Down the road all these greed based  economies collapse into increased corruption, ruin and war...

Tom Cuthbert-Sayers,"A lot of this seems to rely on bad-faith arguments. For example, crypto is bad and a scam because capitalists invest in it as a way to make more money. That seems to say more about the enduring malleability of capitalism, than anything about crypto. Hence, your criticism is not about crypto, per se, but rather capitalism. The same can be said about the ""wild-wild-west"" days of crypto and celebrity endorsed rug pulls. True, certainly these are scams, but again to say crypto is inherently bad and a scam only because of some douchebags see an oppertunity to make millions is, again, more of a critique of capitalism than crypto, per se. Regulation will help do away with all that and most, if not all, crpto enthusiasts want regulation to some degree. What extent exactly is another conversation all together, however. Thirdly, your claim that crypto mining uses huge amounts of energy is a known fallacy. The environmental impacts of mining is negligible comparative to most ""big businesses"". Fourth, NFT's are a part of crypto, perhaps. But it certainly does not exhaust it.

The reality no matter what the product is when people are able to influence easy influence able people to buy it for any reason its just basic marketing.
The question is why are you offended whey you give in to one marketed product over another or any at all. at best the marketing is annoying.

The crypto bubble was exacerbated by the Bitcoin halving which created a supply shock for Bitcoin its issuance rate halved leading to a mania. If you cherry pick the starting and ending dates as Jan 2021 and Jan  2023 then of course it is easy to make Crypto look like a ponzi scheme. But If you were to other dates such as Jan 2019 and Jan 2023, for example, you will see that the market cap of Crypto has tripled.

I always stick to the main coins that financial institutions and people like Elon Musk are using for their businesses. Shiba is one of the most altish ""alt-coins"" I use. I didn't get too far into the NFT game, I tried to sell my art I've made, no one bought it, but I don't think NFT was really about Art at a point. It was just a big hype game like you said. Whenever I saw artists and non-tech people promoting NFT's and Crypto coins I kinda assumed those were a scam. My friend got into them and is in the hole right now. I think NFT's have a great use case if it was used with physical services, but I would never pay a lot of money for a picture that anyone else can see online, that ISN'T physical at all. I was trying to sell my Art AND also give people prints with a purchase but I guess since I wasn't a ponzi scheme no one would help hype my NFT's up. I don't think ALL crypto is a scam. But I do think there are a lot of scams out there that people need to recognize and only stick with the stuff with REAL use cases. Art is awesome, but most popular NFT's aren't about art.

Bitcoin it's just a better dollar, dollar was a better gold (easier to carry and transact) until it lost connection with gold, now dollar is purely people AND government trust. The switch would me made when a btc transaction is legalized wich of course governments don't want, how are they gonna print money?.

Eth tech eclipsed Visa or Mastercard transactions already and the program interface makes it have a value proposition.

The whole point is, we are the problem, not the technology, we change the government rules and good bye corruption.

About deflation, gold as a currency was deflationary and never had any issues.

Brett Denaro,"An NFT allows you to digitize any physical asset. Think real estate for example. A thousand people can take ownership in a block of condos. Ownership is broken up through NF Tokens and those tokens increase in price as real estate prices increase, but each token receives income from rent.  NFT's, while they started out as simple JPG's, will morph into so much more in the coming years. Another use case that is going to turn finance upside down is something like Ripples cross-border payments technology. They have a messaging system (like SWIFT) but also use the XRP token which enables instant settlement (which SWIFT can not do). So this enables banks to eliminate Nostro-Vostro accounts and use that locked up money for other investments (billions of dollars are locked up in Nostro/Vostro accounts) . This technology goes far beyond what is used today, but Ripple has onboarded a few hundred banks and payment providers all over the world (not to mention, Countries are looking at Ripple technology for their CBDC).

Considering the NFT's right now, it's indeed about public ownership.

Right now it's like something so new and immature that people don't see that. Because they didn't and thought to make money with, but actually lost, changes people's mindset on this. Eventually it will be made more mature. It just takes time to develop. The minds behind it and the initial investors are getting paid for their initial effort.

buttcoin present itself as a legitimate case for being a store of value - imagine if you ""own"" gold; all the institutions who ""buy"" gold don't actually ""store"" gold by themselves.

But what would happen to their asset if the government (like the back in 1934) banned the ownership of gold or if there is a war/anarchy and the organization who's STORED your gold suddenly lost it?
Ok, but let's say, you are the own custody of the gold you bought. How are you going to store it? In a safe? What if you get robbed; or what if you are rich? How are you going to store all that tons of gold?

All of the content in the documentary is very accurate. Nontheless, it's too focused on the obviously scam, the NFTs, which as it's very clearly said it's all about promoting the mass adoption. Well, everyone who has been in the space for more than 4-5 years now knows about this. And also that all this subject is just the beginning of the real point, which we are all going to watch happening in the next 30 years, probably. But we have to make clear that most of the people who is watching this does not even understand the magnitude of the whole thing. Once you reach a proper amount of money to provide yourself and your beloved ones a pretty easier life, (and it does not matter if you have cash or crypto, if you worked it or you recieved it as a gift) you will necessary need to pass through the wolves who reside within each one of our countries, the central banks. They will take, in most of the cases, 25% of the amount that you invested, plus 25% of the amount you recieved or made through your work, which leaves you with a tiny part of what's truly yours. It's not a fucking secret, we've been stolen by them for the last 300 years this way. The only thing happening here is people being aware now of what they are loosing every single day of their lives. In my country, for example, if you are a business person you won't start taking profits from your work until june, considering a natural year from january to december. It does not matter if you put that money into stocks, bonds, yields, gold, start a new business, buy a house... whatever. I know all this sounds apocalyptical economically for someone who is not very into it, but wait for the crypto money from the central banks (CDCs). It will be then when people will understand the real meaning and difference between bitcoin and the rest. We always need the practical method to understand things.",2023-01-29T21:28:01Z

There are some interesting projects out there that do make use of blockchain and unfortunately what you will see (or not see) is how these projects will integrate into our daily lives without us even knowing we are using them. I really do believe that decentralized currency is a system that will ultimately replace traditional money backed by governments. It is absurd in the modern era to have a vaccine or insulin shot cost drastically different amounts in other parts of the world. Crypto will ultimately bring equality to markets and consumers. Yes, there are scams, a metric shit ton of them, but the idea will ultimately win out and become mainstream. Bitcoin is not sustainable and its own market is starting to realize it.

Jay Glascoe,"Well, you certainly challenged my belief in Bitcoin.  But I'm onboard with all the other ""shitcoins"" being Ponzi schemes (yes, ETH is a ""shitcoin"").

You make the point that no one transacts using BTC.  Well, people who invest in gold don't make transactions directly in gold either.  

BTC is kind of like gold but better.  Gold has an annual devaluation of about 4% due to more gold being mined every year (and gold mining technology improving every year, so it remains at 4% year after year).  Then there's also the likelihood that a few decades from now some space cowboy is going to lasso a heavy metals asteroid into earth orbit (the ultimate gold mining technology) and mine the shit out of it.  At that point, I expect for the price of gold (and platinum, and uranium, ...) to plummet due to a huge increase in supply.  But BTC will endure.

chino1127,"Bitcoin gets a huge amount of attention from content creators, the press, media, analysts, investors and so called experts, but the reality is it's a relatively small financial phenomena.  The current market cap sits around $450B.  That's about 1/5 the size of Apple, alone.  Perhaps it's worth making a similar video about gold, which is estimated to be worth $12T in total yet has limited utility uses other than being a good conductor. Most of its value is attributed to its perceived scarcity, which is why we wear it around our necks, on our fingers, etc.  It's a stranger concept to me, that someone can hand you a block of mined metal as payment - yet we accept this as truth. 

The entire premise around the world's equity markets is predicated on the idea that the earliest buyer wins.  The notional value of the derivatives market is over $600T and that is an entirely zero sum game.  There's always a loser to every winner, but we don't call that a scam, rather we see it as a legalized way for investors to make bets against each other.  If I buy bitcoin today, I take just as much risk as everyone else.  Do I make money if many more people after me buy it?  Sure.  Do I lose, if the many others who bought/mined before me sell?  Yes.  Is it fair to call that a scam?",2023-01-29T11:07:09Z

Thing is, you only cover the dire dire negatives of cryptocurrencies, and none of its positives.

You must also realise that crypto is essentially in its beta form. Each dumpster fire, from the ICO mania to axie infinity's SLP token mechanism, were failed attempts that have since been improved upon. This is conveniently left out of the video. 

I know it's a big ask, but if you read this comment I encourage you to go out and try and find your own information, but don't frame your search on finding the worst parts of crypto.

nl hn,"The big problem with crypto is it poses to be a money, or a stock, with no actual value behind it.
In the real world, money or a stock represent a portion of some real thing.  Money is the value of a country's economy.  Stock is a portion of a company.  These things all have real dollar values; they are valuable.  Demand for a stock, on the other hand, inflates the value so that it is worth a bit more than it actually is.  However, making more portions of one thing lowers the value.
An object typically gains real value because it can do something that benefits people, or because it is made of a material; generally both.  Note that neither of these things rely on the perception of value.

Of course, crypto starts off with no value.  It is valueless, literally just the state of memory that can't be used to do anything.  It serves no purpose.
It can't serve the purpose of money, because what money is is a portion of an economy, and this has no economy.
It can't be stock because stock is the portion of a company which makes a product or provides a service that already makes money.  That isn't what crypto is.

So crypto has no real value.  It is worth $0, maybe even $- because it costs energy to run it all.  

That means crypto makes all of its value from demand, purely demand.  That isn't stable.  If it loses demand, the value will drop to $0, and then it will be a net cost on everyone that still has it, since they are losing money.  Everything about crypto is superficial.",2023-01-29T03:24:55Z
UnderTheGoldenGate,"OK, so an NFT on a digital asset - the rights are enforced by who? If you purchase it, do you own the copyright/trademark? I assume you do, correct, or is that not even true?  There isn't any digital enforcement of this at this time in scale, or anytime in the near future that I can see.  So in order to enforce it (assuming you own the copyright/trademark) you need to get the law involved.  So why is the NFT better than a regular contract?  OK, so maybe you don't need a hire a lawyer, but how much does a lawyer cost, given that you can download the relevant legal docs yourself. And is is there any legal precedent to use an NFT to sue somebody for copyright infringement?  The fact that I have NEVER, EVER seen anybody talk about this, and explain it, is extremely suspicious.  Yea Ethereum has contracts, but prove that this works in scale, right now or will sometime in the next 5 years....I seriously doubt it. It looks like the geeks that WORSHIP crypto are swimming in an ocean full of dangerous creatures (i.e. scams, lack of enforcement, etc.) and they are too IN LOVE with the technology or the prospect of high returns from these things to think in terms of reality.

Even all the so called crypto experts always mention the value of a transaction, coin, profit, or whatever IN DOLLARS. Lol. Your 13-year comparison to the internet will put the nail in the coffin.

294 63,"A lot of things you said are correct, however, crypto does have a utility, especially for online shops. When I buy software or license keys for programs and such, many individual sellers accept multiple coins and it's way simpler to send crypto to someone than with credit cards, especially where sometimes payment processors take a way bigger fee than crypto gas fees.

For trading crypto, many people analyze the market and buy/sell based on the current situation. Different people see crypto value differently, and just like with stocks, some people do buy at the top and sell at the bottom, so the losers give money to the winners in both cases. With crypto, it is a fight between who buys the lowest and trading is guessing where the buyers will stop buying and selling then, but buying again  when people stop selling and start buying. I don't see the crypto market collapsing as people will always buy and accumulate when the price is low, and will always sell when the price is high. Some buy high and lose, but the price will restore some day, because more people will buy it at a lower price. Other people buy high again and the cycle repeats. When no one has the majority of supply, millions of people would have to sell at lower and lower prices for a coin to collapse, but they won't, as it will rise again from people buying.",2023-01-28T21:45:10Z

End of 2020 28k, end of 2021 46k,  now 23k.  Its value is tied to the easy flow of the US dollar, high rates, high electrical cost, taxes extra all put bitcoin in the negative.

Most NFT, and crypto are a scam; key word MOST.  I like the Idea of NFT's being used in legal contracts / something like a timeshare for a real home. But most of all the NFT's don't have that value add. 

web 3.0 is more about ""I can build something with my own rules and I don't have to be at the whims of Youtube policy"".

You said bitcoin was or is a religion, but what do they believe in? Monetary freedom? In the end you can track every transaction? So you can't do illegal things with it. You said that much energy is wastet on bitcoin. Why is this energy needed for bitcoin? How much energy is it? Why is it not anywerelse used? You said that Bitcoin is a ponzi. Why this ponzi going down in value by like 80%? Shouldn't it go always up? Why is fiat money not a ponzi? Why do many countries have 10%, others 100% inflation and some even lose their money? Are these ponzi's aswell? Why does this kind money still exist? Is a collapsing money system now and than better for the people? You said bitcoin has 7 transactions per second. But what about lightning? Isn't that faster? You said that NFT's just store a link to a picture on a website, why does it not store the picture? You said that you can easily make a picture of an NFT and this undermines the ownership. Does it mean I can copy a song or a movie and it is now mine?

Nothing backs it up (Gold standard long gone) and USD is 95% transacted Digitally vs 100% for btc, but you cant see the workings behind it whereas u can for Bitcoin.  NFT is smoke like Art is ...is a painting worth 160 million usd?  Clearly NFT /usd/paintings/gold are only worth what people think its worth.  NFT is ridiculous, i would agree.....but BTC/ETHER is like gold , a store of value...,. albeit gold at least has a physical use.  But still, there is no shortage of gold OR OIl, yet the price is way higher than supply and demand should show....There IS a limited supply of BTC.   As for scam artist there were plenty in crypto due to the naivety of the public, but there are scams every day in dollar, art, 2nd hand car transactions...its not a CRYPTO issue, its the issue of naive consumers....

Crypto is based on a a blockchain which is essentially a sequential database.  There are not many use cases that really benefit from a public blockchain for the database...a good one would be election voting records for example or car and house sales records - house deeds etc.  There are therefore only a certain number of crypto projects that are legit and have value and many other entrepreneurs or scammers have  tried to jump on the bandwagon an come up with some crackpot scheme to sell worthless tokens to the public.  There ARE some worthwhile ones....need to look carefully at the economic case.",2023-01-28T12:48:11Z

Joshua Daem,"The BIGGEST PROBLEM that the ONE PERCENT has...

MEANING...

Buy as much worthless, overpriced, fraudulent shhh as possible to keep their money from benefiting anyone, anything, anywhere.

Burning their money won't work. Stashing it in an account won't either.

Their money needs to spent on worthless, pointless, useless crap, to have the desired effect they seek.

Like $600 toilet seats, 5 million dollar boat docks in the middle of grass fields, ridiculously overpriced art, priceless pieces of fake antiquity, fraudulent works of art...

Has anyone seen the movie 'BREWSTER'S MILLIONS'?

The guy had to spend all of his money (30 million), and have the receipts to show for it, having a total value of nothing at the end of 30 days, to win the big prize of 300 million.

Buying icebergs and postmarking rare stamps... running for mayor and losing on purpose, renting the Yankees (or was it the Mets?). There's an older version and one with Richard Pryor and John Candy.

Vito C,"From The Little Prince (1943):

“And what do you do with these stars?"" 

""What do I do with them?"" 

""Yes."" 

""Nothing. I own them."" 

""You own the stars?"" 

""Yes"" 

""But I have already seen a king who--

"" ""Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter."" 

""And what good does it do you to own the stars?"" 

""It does me the good of making me rich."" 

""And what good does it do you to be rich?"" 

""It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered."" 

""This man,"" said the little prince to himself, ""reasons a little like my poor tippler..."" Nevertheless, he still had some more questions. 

""How is it possible for one to own the stars?"" 

""To whom do they belong?"" the businessman retorted, peevishly. 

""I don't know. To nobody."" 

""Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it."" 

""Is that all that is necessary?"" 

""Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else , you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever though about owning them."" ""Yes, that is true,"" said the little prince. ""And what do you do with them?"" ""I administer them, "" replied the businessman. ""I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence."" 

The little prince was still not satisfied. ""If I owned a silk scarf,"" he said, ""I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven..."" 

""No. But I can put them in the bank."" 

""Whatever does that mean?"" 

""That means I write down the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key."" 

""And that is all?"" ""That is enough,"" said the businessman. 

""It is entertaining,"" thought the little prince. ""It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."" On matters of consequence the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups. ""I myself own a flower,"" he continued his conversation with the businessman, ""which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars..."" 

The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.",2023-01-28T09:30:04Z

First off, how much energy is wasted to power useless products like Facebook?  What about to power banks to keep their lights on, or pay for their systems?  

Btc is a store of value/speculation product.  Just like gold/silver…. Just like stocks, just like commodities.  

I can hop on a plane and have 20 milllion of value on me via a memorized 12 word phrase.  Bitcoin is the only way this is possible.  

You don’t understand at all what ETH is and that importance of smart contracts.  Smart contracts are fundamental in automation of many industries.  Swift (biggest payment processor) and Dtcc (main settler of securities, stocks, and financial products) will be using smart contracts and block chain to settle all contracts, and interlink All private/public/government financial systems.

You completely fail to address the evolution of bitcoin, its layered network with lightning, its adoption and direct use for human rights activists, people under authoritarian rule, etc. Africa has been adopting bitcoin as a preferred currency in droves. Lightning network allows millions of transactions a second. Nostr is quickly bootstrapping itself as a a decentralized social media protocol that natively uses lightning for instant micro payments to anybody on the network. 
You also get much wrong about  bitcoin and energy. The energy use is what protects the network and renders it as the only viable decentralized network that we have today, while it also is undergoing innovation with a trajectory for net negative carbon output in a few years (bitcoin miners are capturing methane emissions as the largest reducer of methane gas than any other application as an example). All the copycats and nonsense of crypto is literally an affinity scam from bitcoin.

I did sell a lot of pieces, I was on the top 10 most artwork sold list on Foundation in the early days, already had a community. 

My initial investment into crytpo was just 200$ to initialize the first mints and transactions, I probably made around 70K from selling artworks BUT i never cached out any of it... instead I supported other artists who had amazing arts, bought some pieces I loved and wanted to own, it was never about the money and for me it never will.

However, those good days didn't last long in that space... it rapidly began to just be about the hype the fomo and the gain... I've seen SO MANY SCAMS, a lot of artists ended up with hacked wallets and so many shitty projects, new blockchains and promises everywhere! everything felt like a scam... 6 months into it i got tired of the NFT shilling nonsense and the twitter mentality, so i just stopped trying to promote anything of my own or even follow the artists and pages that got me into this space.

It's so sad, but it is was it is i guess, people...

P.S. please, don't buy NFT's or if you do make sure it's from a reliable artist you want to support, and not those shitty 10000000 collectable bullshit that ALWAYS gets cancelled and rugged pull... And if someone posts anything crypto wise... it's a scam.... 1000000% be careful.

OffKi Official,"Back when the pandemic was just coming into fashion, a lot of people started becoming interested in investing in traditional markets off of the back of the crash... myself included. After all, the prices of stocks across the board were available to buy for low, once-in-a-lifetime, prices. So, I ditched my cocaine habit and opened up my first ever Stocks & Shares ISA and started saving earnestly.

I worked with a guy that also took an interest in investing,,.. but he chose crypto. Knowing full well that crypto was junk, I stayed away from it - after all, there was NO real-world use case for ANY digital currency when you got down to the real truth behind the myriad of projects. 

I managed to save a couple of thousand pounds for the first time ever in my life - which was a massive personal achievement for me. But I was impatient to see the value of my investments increase. I asked my colleague about his gains in crypto, and when he told me I was absolutely shocked! It was this that made me cast off the traditional market for this new, explosive, digital currency market - even though I knew it to be trash - and I put everything I had into it....right around the time that Bitcoin was hitting global headlines for breaking the $50,000 mark for the first time (I actually watched it do this on a live chart!)

It was also a couple of weeks before THAT day.....  

May 19th 2021. 

So, while I had just pumped all my savings into crypto.. the smart money and the more savvy retail investors were walking away with their gains; while the dumb money was being told to HODL... 

..... and HODL I did.

Move forward to today.. and instead of having a reasonably well balanced portfolio - I have a reasonably well balanced crack pipe that can stand upright on my table allowing me to use both hands to flick two lighters together to get a flame.. one lighter has gas, but no flint.. the other has flint, but no gas..... 

So that brings an end to my tale folks. What is the moral of the story here, do you think??

I'll tell you....

""I was wrong about democracy being a viable system.""

""Maybe the sexual revolution was a mistake.""

""The evidence shows that equality of the sexes is destructive.""

""Let's have a debate on if freedom of speech and religion is good for society.""

I was always sceptical of cryptocurrency. For one thing, there were the wild fluctuations in value, for another, there were the criminal uses of it. But the one thing which has stuck in my head the most, is the thought of massive numbers of computers using considerable very real resources in order to do what is fundamentally worthless calculations. By the time NFTs came around, scepticism was turned to animosity, and ""Web 3.0"" can die in a fire.

Or would you rather have something that has a limited supply which is tracked on a decentralized ledger? Bitcoin is a store of value. Bitcoin is digital gold. Bitcoin is NOT like any other cryptocurrency because it is NOT a security. No other asset since it’s inception in 2009 has out performed Bitcoin. 
Is Bitcoin a good currency.. no not really .. it’s a top notch store of value. Countries all over the world are adopting Bitcoin because their fiat currency is worth nothing just like the US Dollar will be soon.

i lost quite a lot of money because of Shiba. more than 50% of my savings.
because i kept buying small amount to get profit on lower price.

i gave up on it. but my cousin still believe in shiba. his loss is a lot greater than mine. he is still holding on to his shiba.
i told him repeatedly to sell it all. no idea if he really still holding his shiba. because i got no access to his crypto wallet. but he told me. that he is still holding on to it.

well.. actually my mom and his mom. and his sister is also a victim. no idea how much they lost. but my mom loss is not much. because she doesn't have a lot of money.

very glad that i decided to take the loss. because if not. my loss is a lot bigger. i sold everything when shiba price was 0.xxxxx2600. i can't remember how much zero it has. but that is more than twice the current price.",2023-01-27T16:15:15Z

If the USD wouldn't be so inflationary BTC wouldn't be deflationary by design. So sure you hold to sell it maybe for a profit but due to the inflationary nature of the USD you know, it wouldn't lose value over time when the dust settles of crazy voilatly settels.

The value is determent in my opinion by is it limited? yes you cant make more of it. Is it available? more and more infrastructure is build around it (BTC ATMS). Do people accept it as form of value exchange? (that would be the adoptionphase) some people do some dont.

obviously this is a clear obstruction of justice. if you hold a deed in your wallet, its immutable and non fungible. 

in the same situation the squatter would be asked to provide the deed, they would, it would be proven fake, and they would be promply arrested.

I'll add detail to this view in another comment ""Have Some Nuance""

Any idiot who thinks they can ""get rich quick"" without studying the sector. Any idiot who plonks down money on a NFT with no fundamentals backing it... to make it back... is playing a Tulip Bubble game - yes. But that's their fault.

Occam's Razor,"0:01It's sorta both. It's an interesting experiment into anonymous currency to prevent government control (as in, for example, the CCP and the Uighur population. Not that BitCoin would help them, even if it worked, just an example of what it's an attempt to fix). But it's biggest pro is also its biggest con. Because it's anonymous, it can't be regulated. Which means all the stock scams that don't work on the stock market anymore because of regulation will work on the unregulated BitCoin market (or any cryptocurrency).

Jasper Kerkhof,"Nice video. I agree with most things except for the part that covers Axie Infinity. The token is just the mechanism there, not the cause. The real problem is that game companies are linking in-game currency with actual money because for them it's lucrative business. But it really doesn't matter if these currencies are using blockchain/NFT's or are just managed on a server of the company itself. It's moving your economy to a virtual world which is less regulated in hopes of getting away with things you would never get away with if you did those things in the real world.

Usually it works by allowing a person to buy tokens/gems/trophies (or Axies in this case) or some other form of 'currency' for a certain amount of real life money causing virtual assets in-game to have real value. There are other examples of centralized games where the exact same thing happens and people grind out in-game things in exchange for money in hopes of earning more than what is possible with the opportunities they have back home. 

It's just that the barrier to entry is usually smaller with these games so you don't need this 'Scholar' system which is another layer of evil on top of it, but again this has not that much to do with blockchain. You can just as well make a regular game that is too expensive for poor people and be like 'Hey, I'll provide you with the funds to start playing this game, if in return you give me a percentage of the money you make with it.' 

I think this problem is more a symptom of the direction that games are going into than it is that of cryptocurrencies, although both go hand-in-hand to a certain extent.",2023-01-26T09:51:33Z

humbllbug,"Yahshua - you know Him as Jesus - was born to a virgin, turned water to wine, taught, healed the sick, raised the dead, casted out demons, walked on water, calmed the storm, and fed a crowd of thousands with a few fish and a few loaves of bread on two separate occasions, among many other things. He was killed on the cross as payment for the sins of all mankind, three days later He rose from the dead. Forty days later He ascended into heaven where He sits at the right hand of the Father. He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God (2 Thessalonians 2:1-4 and Revelation 2:10). Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!

if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9

Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13

Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:
Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. To anoint your home or other building: place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick: place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name. See James Chapter 5:14-15....",2023-01-26T08:29:20Z

KafkaesK,"Libya sold oil in their own currency once upon a time instead of dollars and this threatened the power of the dollar. Guess what happened to Muarmar Gaddhafi's anus?

I can be 100% sure that if the cryptocurrency ever threatened the power of the dollar, the response would be far more powerful than SEC regulating a few things. 

The power of a currency comes from it being used in transactions, unless my local hospital starts accepting ether and bitcoin and monero, cryptocurrency is just a ponzi scheme that entices people based on the hope of owning a currency that's going to be powerful in the future which is not going to happen if the value of crypto comes from speculation.

I didn't see anything about CBDCs in this video. Just wait until the banks can put a time-limit or a clause on money: fx- this money needs to be spend before a certain date, or you can only use this money to pay your bills etc. It's dystopian, but a very likely scenario.

The difference between Satoshi and Madoff is that the gov proved you can hurt the poor, but you can't hurt the rich. MMs control the market and take money from uneducated traders while the rich give their money to these firms to generate more wealth off the backs of the population. If you defraud the rich, you get hurt, but if you manipulate the market in favor of the rich, you are invincible.

Satoshi isn't competing. These protocols offer an escape from this 2-tier system (rich and poor). However, Bitcoins lacks fungibility, which will kill itself due to this fundamental error that makes it a property and not a commodity",2023-01-25T18:17:28Z

I agree that there are a lot of garbage coins/apps/idea's in crypto, but how many bad companies are started worldwide that never make it, and investors loose there money. I never got why anyone would invest in something only because a ""famous"" person thinks it is a good idea. The direct line you draw between obvious scams and the whole crypto market isn't well done. There are a whole lot more good actors than the few bad actors you like to display in your video. What's even worse in my opinion is your shortsighted explanation of Bitcoin, and the well informed people in Bitcoin. For the people who don't like this comment: No, I am not right winged. No, I am not anti government, No I am not a Bitcoin maxi. I'm just a guy interested in the technology and what it might bring as an alternative (not replacement) of store of value and currency.

When I pointed out that the USD had value because of the US government's legal authority to tax it's constituents' labor and production, they would shrug and claim another ambiguous crypto trait.

While others continue to trade without fear of losses, others are patient. It all depends on the pattern you are trading and also the source of your signals.

There are much more complications than some would have you believe. In this video we just stick to the data, not appealing to the emotions of those who choose to ignore it.

All these weird derivatives and loan products are useless to me and I've been in the blockchain space for 12 years. I tried using one of these yield projects once, Thyme Wonderland and it didn't work. I just don't really care about defi. Bitcoin is great for transferring value.

We shouldn't blame the new idea, the new invention, the new tool. Here we should only blame ourselves and our modern nature and modern priorities. There are hundreds or maybe even thousands of examples on how an invention or a concept has found a critical use case years after it's inception.

I know everyone has their opinions, but there are actual use cases for crypto that have already proven themselves, like sending it across the globe in seconds, or being able to store it more securely than any other asset or having public transactions to identify senders/receivers, etc. Most of the use cases rely on adoption with companies accepting it as payment, but adoption was also exactly what the internet needed in order to work.

Also a reminder that the point of ""people who buy intend to sell to someone else at a later date"" is the exact way the entire stock market works, except the stock market has far less use cases. So either both the stock market and crypto are a big ponzi, or neither are.",2023-01-25T03:41:26Z

Jmasta7,"Very well produced video, and without a doubt crypto has been a smear on society for the last few years.  But it also has some use cases that are truthfully viable.  Gold still has a use in our society today -- bitcoin is a much more practical form of gold.  Admittedly, bitcoin has serious energy issues to resolve,.  However if you do research it, Bitcoin likely consumes much less energy than the current banking or gold industries do right now.  The reason it's inconclusive is because Bitcoin's energy usage can be accurately calculated, since all transactions are recorded.  Banking and gold do not boast that.  And .  Ethereum has potential to spawn a new secure voting system, which would be highly beneficial for the world now -- election accuracy has caused marked controversy as recently as this year in Brazil, and clarity in this area would hopefully serve to dispel some of the tribalism that cripples our society now.",2023-01-24T21:24:49Z

Edin Fifić,"Watching this video (and the world in general), I keep thinking ""Monkey see, monkey do"", and you actually have the part where people use monkeys for their profile pictures, just proving the old adage 100% correct.
I have often said that humans in general have not become any more intelligent than 10000 years ago; we have only changed ways of doing things. I would even argue that the average IQ has dropped in the last couple centuries - the higher intelligence we so often celebrate is of the exceptional few individuals, not of the society as a whole.

P.S.: None of the celebrities' choices to follow any dumb trend have surprised me. They are humans like everybody else, prone to stupid mistakes, but the misfortune is that they get to set, generally lower, standards which masses of people follow.",2023-01-24T16:07:06Z

BitFloh,"Please dive deeper into this topic. Yes cryptocurrencies are most likely all ponsi schemes except bitcoin. Bitcoin is the first digital money in witch nobody have to trust each other. It’s uninflatable, unconfiscable and censorship resistance. I encourage to questioning the current money system. What is money? How is it produced? How does inflation come about? What is the history of money? What is fiat money? What are central banks doing? Whats the cantillon effect? What is keynesian economics? What is austrian economics? Many come to the conclusion that our current money system is a giant ponsi scheme because It heavily depends on money printing from the central banks. People who see this flee into Bitcoin because Its the only way out. Stocks are inflatable and you have to trust the companies to perform, Cryptocurrencys have central programmers who controls them, Gold and Silver are confiscable and you don’t know how much gold is in circulation and you don’t know if its real or fake gold or silver, government bonds produce their yield through more debt. Bitcoin is the only way out. It’s uninflatable, unconfiscable, censorship resistance, has a maximum supply and you don’t need to trust anyone. People who understand that don't hold bitcoin to get more dollars. They hold Bitcoin to have less dollars. So there are really happy when Bitcoins price in dollars is dropping. I encourage everyone to stack some sats.",2023-01-24T14:42:22Z

I worked at few Andreesson Horowitz startups in the late 90s and mid-2k. While I learned a ton, and made some life long friends, I want to say that I’m surprised by their investing in the NFT/Web3 (absolutely hate this term), but I’m not. VC firms tend to shift to the latest craze so they can exploit whatever that craze is and bring a profit.

I’m in the infosec space and the number of ‘blockchain’ security startups is absolutely ridiculous. I tend to troll them by asking when they’re going to add the terms quantum and machine learning/AI to their press kits.

Since I travel a lot, I thought that the best use of crypto would be to use one currency across the globe and make transactions in seconds to people living on the other side of the planet. However, once you get money into crypto, which can take days as you have to verify wallets and stuff, sending money is even worse as the other party uses a different blockchain, thus you have to first transfer to that and then transfer the money, all with cost involved. I hoped this could bring the US banking system into the 21st century but it failed miserably.

dog,"Considering that we live in such an unequal time financially, where wages haven't met growth since the 70s, where costs are going up and up. No wonder young people (mostly men) bought into this - the American Dream 'go to college, work the 9 to 5 at the high paying job, get married, have kids' playbook just doesn't work anymore. You have to be the miracle 'from nothing to something' grindset playboy or you're a loser who missed their chance.

All the wealth and power has been scrounged up and the already wealthy are very careful not to lose out on what could be a system-shifting technology that reorganises wealth in society (like what happened in the early days of the internet and computers, and smartphones), there is increasingly less and less that ordinary people can afford to own - unless you inherit or use your fat trust fund to get you halfway.

As it becomes more and more obvious to more and more young people that it was and will always be rigged from the start, and as people get more and more aware of what capitalism is and who is powerful and why - people will be more attracted to socialism and fascism again.

All the NFT scams, the countless number of new cryptos being pumped and dumped, and shady crypto exchanges exiting with peoples money have given crypto a bad name.

There are more examples, NFTs could make the transfer of ownership (of any object, digital or tangible) much cheaper, faster and easier. 
I do agree that there is a lot of scam in this industry, but this was the case with all bg technological inventions (telephone, internet). Criminals are always among the first adopters of a new technology. But I think it is a mistake to label the whole space as criminal and fraudulent, because this is not the case.

It can also be very fast through the lightning network although greater scalability comes at a cost. After more than 2 years in the space, I am proud to have and hold bitcoin. I still believe that it holds the key to protecting ourselves from the rise of totalitarian governments. I can be both my own banker and agree to my own economic policy, thanks to it.

Cornelius Servius,"That which exists in the wake of Bitcoin - ""Crypto"", was surely an unintended consequence. It gave smaller players the opportunity to run the scams previously reserved for wall street without needing to pay the protection fees.

It's a paradox; Bitcoin gives financial freedom to prosper, but also the financial freedom to make mistakes and to get scammed.

Bitcoin is technically functioning as intended, but is inevitably producing unintended consequences which are separate from Bitcoin itself. 

It's a mistake to view Bitcoin as a ""get rich quick"" vehicle. It is also a mistake to think you can make a clone of Bitcoin and it retain the same value proposition.",2023-01-22T23:52:58Z

Chaz D,"Look man, I’ll start out by saying , good video , and well put together. But your logic is flawed. There is no doubt many many crypto and NFT scams out there and def buyer beware. Where there’s people, there’s corruption because there will always be corrupt people. But to lump Bitcoin in the same basket as the rest is wrong. Bitcoins value lies in the fact that it is all verified by code, not people, and open source code verifiable by anyone who wishes to therefore it takes the corruption out of it. Exchanges maybe centralized sure, but Bitcoin isn’t. Centralized exchanges may fall (FTX) but that will pave the way for Decentralized exchanges to rise. 

My next point is that calling Bitcoin a scam because people buy it with the hope to sell it later for more makes no sense either. By that same rationale is gold a scam? Cause I’m sure as heck people don’t buy gold to hope to sell it for less later. It’s just a natural way of things because what other or better options are there? You didn’t give any alternatives in your video. You suggest holding fiat? Controlled by dirty centralized banks and corrupt governments and which is subject to annual inflation. Keeping your value in cash and you’re losing more than you think. Year over year of compounding inflation and your buying power is falling fast. 

As far as using power, over 50% of Bitcoin is mined using renewable and clean energy. And to say there’s no real use case for it is wrong on so many levels. You believe the internet was a revolution cause you use it on a daily basis. What would you say to the people who called it a scam years ago due to lack of understanding? To me that’s exactly how you sound.",2023-01-22T22:10:45Z

I know how fucked up media is on everything and their trail of getting things wrong about financial markets and hyping things up like they all know how

J K,"First of all: congrats for the good production.

Unfortunately, this view is very one-sided - you did not even mention one of the positive sides of crypto. And yes, there are quite a few, also from a purely objective point of view (avalability of value transaction for underbanked or heavily censorship-friendly countries - like China, escape from government-caused hyperinflation - for example in Turkey). There are even some governments working together with crypto projects to increase efficiency (Australia for example is working together with Energy Web to revolutionize the energy system and support green energy).


Of course crypto has drawn in a significant amount of bad actors that shed a bad light on crypto, but if you compare it to the traditional financial system - it is exactly the same there, if not even worse. People are just not talking about that and it's not made as visible to the public as crypto scams. 

You should definitely re-evaluate your view on crypto and do less one-sided research on the topic.

Emin 893,"Bitcoin being deflationary, isn't that actually a good thing? I mean currencies like the USD, Euro, Yen, etc. ideally want around 2% inflation in order to achieve economic growth. However, isn't economic growth and inflation the main problem (or at least one of the big problems) behind waste? Which in turn has a negative effect on the environment?

Another thing is, by the logic of 'Bitcoin with the intention to sell at a later date for a higher price, and therefore being a Ponzi'. Doesn't this apply to gold and other assets, as well as stocks or any other financial instrument? If that is the case then why is Bitcoin being singled out? Every financial asset has it's own unique selling points, so to does Bitcoin (being decentralized and a being hedge against currencies/monetary policies), right?

Get rich quick schemes are a bane of the financial world. Since crypto is still in the early stages, it is more prevalent. But these schemes used in the crypto space actually originated from the financial world and overall consumerism. How is: ""If you own a Louis Vuitton bag, you are in"" different from ""if you own a NFT, you are in""? How fair is it to then just generalize these arguments over the whole space? Then the same can be said over the overall financial market?",2023-01-22T12:48:33Z

In this scenario I assume most NFT creators will attempt to rug pull to get what they can and cash out, leaving alot of people high and dry ontop of everything else, with no money coming in and everything trying to get out the chain goes down and crashes, anything with value at that point will be utterly worthless.  While there has been many rug pulls and large projects failing, nothing has been... big enough to cause that kind of panic.  The delusional cultist talk among investors is... astounding, I am surprised they haven't balked yet.  NFT's don't grow in value or scarcity, there is no return on investment unless you sell so.. the whole diamond hands thing is an utter joke, you should sell as soon as things look like its taking a turn for the best and run.

It only stays afloat through the printing of more money. If the printing was to stop, and new money therefore stopped flooding the system, it would implode. The use of fractional reserve banking also has many interesting and concerning implications, which I think you would do a fantastic job at exploring.",2023-01-21T23:22:16Z

RawDog,"As a crypto invester myself, yes the recent hype around nonsensical particular NFT's that provide nothing to society was abhorent and stupid. Think of it like buying a steak for $10,000... just to say that you can. In reality nobody benefits from that, except maybe the chef...but even they can't belive it. Luckily I never fell into that trap. That said, I still believe that decentralised digital currency is important. It brings democracy to currency, rather than allowing the wealthiest entities in the world to write the monetary rules on behalf of everyone else. Bitcoin is flawed and not the end game, just a stepping stone, and almost everything else in the space is a cash grab. But this is early days, the first steps towards a better system.

Side note: The whole 'the only reason to buy bitcoin is to sell it to some other poor sucker for a profit' (ie a 'Ponsy scheme)...... well, News Flash.. that's exactly how the dollar works. Infact thats how the whole global currency and stock markets works. What do yo think Wall street does? They buy shit and sell it to some poor sucker for a profit... including dollars.

With bitcoin you can. ALso when the government prints more money, inflating the fiat currency you have in your bank account, thats not happening with bitcoin.

I still believe that once regulations are in place, the scams and useless projects die out, and many existing problems are solved, we will see integration into the economy in some way, but it's hard to guess to what extent.

Do more research next time to avoid spewing a bunch of disingenuous misinformation. For example you talk about transactions per second but fail to talk about the lightening network which is the layer 2 scaling solution and can easily do 10x the amount of transactions that Visa or Mastercard can do. Also you never touched on how proof of working mining incentivizes using stranded energy such as flared methane from landfills or that it can help greatly build out renewable energy. The last and more important thing is you never once touched on how this technology can help the billions of people in developing countries that live under authoritarian regimes or double digit inflation.

In order for any asset to increase in value someone has to lose money. Even houses are a ponzi scheme, why should they ever cost more than the materials and labour to build them.
It's a massive oversimplification to call Bitcoin a ponzi, it is no worse than any of the others I mentioned. Value is purely belief, if everyone thinks it's valuable, it is, if no one thinks it's valuable, it isn't, unless it's an object that can solve a problem. A knife is always valuable, a bar of gold is useless on a dessert Island. Inflation is proof that our whole economy is a ponzi!",2023-01-20T14:29:16Z

אכן הרבה הונאות של אנשים מסכנים וטיפשים.
יחד עם זאת ביטקוין הוא לא בדיוק הונאת פונזי, כי אין הבטחה של ריבית גבוהה וקבועה על ההשקעה. אנשים משקיעים בתקווה לעליית ערך המטבע. נכון שעליית ערך תלוייה מאוד בביקוש, אבל אנשים לוקחים זאת בחשבון.
ביטקוין הוא נכס לשמירת ערך. בזמנים כמו עכשיו ובעצם מאז 2008 שהדולר מודפס כמו נייר טואלט, חשוב שיהיה נכס שלא ניתן להדפיס בלי סוף.
אכן אין מקום לאינספור מטבעות קריפטו ולכל ההונאות כמו NFT ובורסות קיקיוניות כמו FTX, אבל לביטקוין עצמו אולי יש עתיד.",2023-01-20T13:56:52Z

The doc focuses on NFT’s, not cryptocurrency.  And, if it had been advertised as such instead of the FUD about cryptocurrency as an economic ecosystem, it might have been worth watching for someone thinking of buying NFT’s (i.e. gambling).

Add to a lack of knowledge in basic economic literacy, it is a clear propaganda piece aimed at discrediting a legitimate & important economic revolution.

BTC is a decentralized monetary asset and yeah its value is arbitrary, surprise surprise as that piece of paper note you keep in your wallet and buy stuff with it. We have agreed that its got value.

Bitcoin itself DOES have very real adoption outside of hype and sentiment, but you need to look abroad. People who live in countries with hyper inflating currencies like Venezuela and Lebanon are flocking to bitcoin as a store of value and digital gold. They have the access to buy it in a way that they never would have been able to with physical gold.

It is in its infancy stages right now and still is a technology looking for its use case. NFTs will not always be the useless things they are right now. they will eventually serve a useful purpose in doing something completely different. Crypto technology will eventually run the entire financial system around the world.. it will also serve many other uses you have never even thought of yet. its specifically about the fact that it is a decentralized technology that doesn't run at the whim of any one person, group, or entity. It is the internet of value.. it will carry value in a new way.. Whether you believe in it or not, it will come with or without your support.",2023-01-19T03:01:40Z

quietapplause1,"Very well made documentary. But you missed some balls:
- the reason why Bitcoin goes up is not because you can make money on it, it's mainly because people lack confidence in fiat money that is constantly being printed and losing purchasing power, while Bitcoin gains purchasing power.
- you don't talk about the  true innovation of decentralised blockchains and the concept of trust and ZKP's.

All these are the future of the Internet and how the world will do business - that is a fact.

Jason Maxwell,A Ponzi scheme is when an entity takes people's money and pays back other people with the new investors money. If everyone goes to collect their money at the same time there's not enough money to give back. You mean like the banking system? Because that's exactly what the banks do. Take people's money to pay off other people. And if everyone wanted their money back from the banks at the same time there wouldn't be enough. Except the scam is slightly worse because the banks have the ability to print more fake money. The world financial system is a Ponzi scheme.,2023-01-18T19:41:34Z

Speculation on price and selling to someone else who will hope for similar returns as the person before them. I think crypto is here to stay with many ups and some downs.

Zolani Maboza,"I think, so far, what we are seeing is the fall of the US Dollar, what becomes the solution as now it hasn't been backed up by Gold for years, and how the strength of what that evolved to as the Petrodollar, is also loosing its grip on the countries that provided the US dollar with that assurance. Could it be that, crypto or in-fact BITCOIN, are what VC and Banks trying to express as the next transaction financial system, i.e. USDT & USDT. The rest of the Crypto Space, I would strongly believe that 98% of the tokens and companies have zero use cases nor interest in the robin hood mentality that is being sort of paraded for us....on the other side of that same coin, the 2% remaining will be a success in revolutionizing this web 3.0 era, with viable use cases, the rise of 5G and its speeds for what is to come as that system is still being constructed.


🤷‍♂I mean, your view are very rational and very realistic to compare logically Bitcoin and the entire Crypto space as a Ponzi scheme...it's all a very logical perspective. I would also say this though; nothing revolutionary was ever completely met with open arms....there has not been any real adoption that's been promised yet, no real peer - to - peer adoption for the masses, its still too early to judge success or failure ",2023-01-18T09:48:21Z

Even though I am kind of a techno-anarchist and made a decent amount of money from Bitcoin, I have to admit that I don't like what this industry has turned into at all. It brings out the worst of greed and manipulation in people sometimes. I got into it for the ideals of decentralization of power and money from the people for the people.

In this documentary, there's no mention of what cryptography has done in the world of cyber security and what it can achieve in the future. Web 3.0 is still not decentralized and also uses Ethereum, and have you asked yourself why some people are trying to make the internet decentralized?
All in all, this is a great video about ""Cryptocurrency"" not ""Cryptography"" and a lot of internet users can learn from it, especially the dark side.",2023-01-18T07:54:39Z

This piece was well researched, superbly written, and presented with the usual high production values that you associate with James and his work.  It seems to me that crypto is but another cult, but this time one that is founded in cyberspace, rather than in some physical commune that occupies space in the real world.  It has its high priests, and its devoted followers, and, like any other in-group, it has its own set of beliefs, and even a language of its own to differentiate the believers from the non-believers.  Indeed, those who are non-believers are depicted as trouble-makers, and are condemned as being heretics.  As with anything like this, no good will ever come of it.  Indeed, the capacity for harm is really off the scale.  Thanks for this one, James, and thanks for saying what really needed to be said on this subject.",2023-01-18T02:44:01Z

DarkMagic666,"The problem here is that, ever since the dollar no longer had to be backed by actual gold assets, there is absolutely nothing holding it up but ""the full faith of the U.S. government"". So if our government fails, so fails the dollar. If the country gets into too much debt such that other countries won't accept the dollar as a world currency, so fails our entire system. The dollar has lost 90% of it's value in a relatively small amount of history. Since I started working in the early 1970's, $1 then equals roughly $7 now. So do the math... that's a loss of 86% of the dollar's value in my lifetime.

Unless the stock is giving some kind of dividend to investor it doesn't make difference how company is doing the goal is to attract new investors that will buy that stock from you. Just like with like TSL and similar stocks, company was billions in debt and stock was worth more then all car makers combined which shows its just ponzi that fueled of new investors coming and buying more stocks and making price go up. Nothing in TSL finance changed in that time and now when company is doing much better stock is 60% down. So instead of wealthy Wall Street guys that are running IPOs, getting early deals etc with crypto that moved to ICOs, DAOs and similar organization that get early access to information and can buy before others that will later sell for profit when hype is there. Sadly blockchain has some nice features but like most things in capitalism it is run over by greed.

Why Bitcoin needs electricity > because of security. Why it needs special mining equipment > because a 51% attack is harder. Bitcoin might not be the paying solution, but it is its security.

Bitcoin has no CEO like these other projects. There will only ever be 21m. You say its centralised as you have to go through an exchange but if youre smart you buy on the exchange and withdraw to your own private wallet. There is a saying, not your keys not your coin. Bitcoin does have a use case as a store of value similar to gold and as a cheap and easy way to send payments globally in a short space of time. Agree that NFTs and 99% of these projects are scams.

The battle to make the government actually serve the people isnt over. Look at all the strides we have made throughout decades.

Just because there is cultist behavior doesnt mean there are no good debates happening. Just because there are scammers and fraudulent investors does not mean there is no good underlying technology. The fact you write off blockchain as a buzz word shows that you do not understand the advantages of privacy, security and decentralization it can bring as opposed to WEB2 or the current internet model. We live in a society where data leaks and privacy are non existent, perhaps you should do a documentary on that instead and why that is. Perhaps dive a bit deeper into counter arguments and technological debates instead of sketching scammers and community cultist behaviors as the only means being used. As a filmmaker I acknowledge your skills, as a neutral analist you have totally failed. Maybe you should work as a storyteller, like become a politician. Should fit you better.",2023-01-17T08:26:25Z

Mitchell Dale,"I think this video moves on too quickly after pointing out that NFTs mostly just consist of a hyperlink on the blockchain. It doesn't matter much that other people can also access that link. However, literally every cryptocurrency or crypto asset is supposed to derive its worth from the decentralisation that comes with blockchain technology. That monkey JPEG might not have any intrinsic value, but at least it's supposed to be YOUR monkey JPEG in a way that no central authority has the power to take away from you. But if the blockchain is just storing a link to it on some image hosting website... Then you're completely reliant on a central authority in the form of whoever's hosting that site. They could take the site down or delete your monkey JPEG or replace it with something else and there's nothing you can do about it. The blockchain does nothing to protect you from that. So what's the fucking point?

Even if we play along and pretend that these pieces of ""digital art"" have just as much worth as real, tangible goods, this is kind of like paying the price of a Lamborghini for a receipt that only says ""I own the contents of the garage at this address"" without specifying what those contents are. At the time you made the purchase there was a Lamborghini in there, but somebody else has the keys to both the garage and the Lamborghini and could at any time remove it and replace it with a fucking golf cart or nothing at all and you have zero legal recourse if that happens. You don't have a document saying you own the Lamborghini itself, you just have your little piece of paper that lists the garage's address and no proof that a Lamborghini was ever in there. Even if you can prove it (e.g. Wayback Machine or something), it doesn't matter much because your receipt isn't a legally enforceable document or anything, it's just something you show off for clout.",2023-01-17T05:09:32Z

GetGud,"Bitcoin did not become something new when Satoshi disappeared.  It still works essentially the same as it did back then.  You can still run a node with 2014 software and it is still compatible.  Bitcoin also has not failed.  Adoption is still increasing as well as the security of the network.  It has not replaced major central bank currencies yet, but the jury is still out on whether or not it ever will.  Also, Bitcoin cannot meet the definition of a Ponzi scheme since there are no expectations of returns.  Ponzi schemes by definition require an expectation of a return and those returns being paid by new investors investing.  If you only buy one bitcoin, you will only ever have one bitcoin.  You might be able to find somebody willing to pay you more than you paid for it, but that is not a ponzi.",2023-01-16T19:59:07Z

There is one thing it came way to short in my opinion. Bitcoin isn't the problem - the people are. The idea and usecase with bitcoin is clear and there are many good arguments to the critics like wasting energy and scaling stuff. I'm not the biggest expert, but I can try to explain something if needed. If you take a look what fiat currency is and how it works, you will discover that the money isn't the problem. It's the state and the people again. The most argument against crypto you can use for fiat too and there is more trouble. For example the energy critic for proof of work. Do you think the whole fiat system don't need energy? It's a bit of short thoughts if you bring bitcoin in a context with token, NFTs and Web3. Bitcoin isn't any of this scam stuff. I really think it would have been better to separate this more. Furthermore ask people who haven't bank account or anything. We're looking from a really privileged perspective. You know what I mean? I understand everything in your video and the most time I'm totally with you. But in the end we have to ask for the roots of the problem. And this is, what came to short in my eyes.

Ross Stephenson,"I asked ChatGPT

""Is crypto a scam?""

Here's what ChatGPT replied:

""Cryptocurrency, also known as digital or virtual currency, is a form of decentralized currency that uses cryptography for security. Like any investment, there is a risk of losing money. However, not all cryptocurrencies or projects in the cryptocurrency space are scams. It's important to thoroughly research any investment before putting money into it. Some projects may not have a strong team, a viable product, or a solid plan for success, which can increase the risk of the project being a scam. It's also important to note that some countries have a stricter regulations and oversight on crypto than others, so it's always recommended to keep an eye on the legal status of any crypto project you might consider investing in.""",2023-01-16T03:59:04Z

Whereas bitcoin is 100% percent transparent, every transacion is public, thus bitcoin is not a scam, even more ... it cannot be a scam! On the other hand bitcoin brokers can be scams. But scams aside, bitcoin for sure is in speculative bubble, same as gold, facebook, amazon ... and many others, unfortunately this is what happens when people doesn't want inflationary FIAT crap. One more thing; bitcoin is not a currency! In most countreies it is regulated by law as a property, thus you need to pay taxes! Have a good day ;)",2023-01-16T00:02:09Z

Bitcoin transactions are slow… therefore worse than Mastercard. But you are comparing a centralised entity vs. a decentralised one.

Nik One,"Normie: Bitcoin is based on nothing. It's a Ponzi scheme!

Me: Bitcoin was created as a secure, digital currency, as a way to break away from the Central Banking system that removes 50% of the purchasing value from the US Dollar every 5 years by way of inflation. Bitcoin is decentralized (no CEO or company behind it that can be bribed or threatened) its price is based purely on market forces and the energy required to mine it (which doubles ever 4 years due to the 'halving'), it has a built-in scarcity of only 21M coins (19M mined so far, the last coin is expected to be mined in the year 2140), it cannot be seized or frozen if kept off Exchanges, and is the only asset known to man that has appreciated from $0.01 in 2009 to $21,000 in 2023. While Silver has lost a 3rd of it's value in that time and Gold has remained stagnant in price and actually dropped when inflation is factored it, Bitcoin keeps going up in price. It's the only scarce and desired asset that can be sent to the other side of the earth in minutes for the transfer cost of $0.05. No banks, middle men, paperwork, IRS involved. While telling us to keep away from it, the largest bank in the USA ""JP Morgan"" has been buying up Bitcoin like crazy, investing in exchanges and funding mining operations. Central Banks have also been doing the same. Like the internet, Bitcoin has had its predictable ups and downs. Never forget the Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman claimed the internet was a fad and by 2005 it would have no larger effect on our lives than the fax machine. And when the dot-com crash happened, many people thought the internet was a dead project. It's now thousands and thousands of times larger and more profitable now than at its highest hay day during the dot com boom.


Normie: Bitcoin created nothing.

Me: Wrong. Satoshi not only created Bitcoin, but also solved the ""double spend"" problem. Blockchain was also developed with Bitcoin, so there are 3 major inventions there. The double spend problem being solved is already used by websites, banks, credit and debt cards to increase security. Blockchain is being used from everything from inventory cataloging, to social media, to real estate, to eventually the way we vote to prevent voting fraud and to verify votes in a record that will remain forever and cannot be modified; votes could be verified by anyone using the public key and the private key would contain the personal information of the voter.  Each voter will receive a copy of both keys when they vote online or in person. This will be revolutionary to preventing voting fraud, and that's why the elite don't want to see technologies like Bitcoin continue to grow, they know it will lead to a world they don't personally control, a better world imo.


Normie: It can't be valuable as an asset, because Bitcoin crashed during the recession.

Me: Yes, everything crashed. But in the last 2 years, Bitcoin has risen more than stocks, bonds, Gold and Silver COMBINED. At the start of the recession there were approx 250 million Bitcoin wallets. That has risen to over a billion wallets in 2 years. Bitcoin has become the world's fastest and most widely adopted asset. Gold and Silver will never again be used as a currency. We are in the digital age and technology will only increase over time. Other Cryptos may become pennies, nickels, quarters and dollars, but Bitcoin will always wear the crown as digital Gold and a store of value. 

Normie: Yeah, I don't care to learn much about it, so Crypto is a scam.

Me: Crypto may be. There are over 20,000 of those and they are nearly all centralized and controlled. Other cryptos can be shut down by going after the CEO or company behind it. Bitcoin is different than all the other centralized 'copies' out there with a never-ending supply. There is no way to shutdown Bitcoin. You would have to capture the nearly 4 Million mining computers scattered throughout the world to shut it down. As long as there is one computer running mining software that's connected to the internet, Bitcoin will be alive and kicking.

Normie: You planning to sell your Bitcoin for millions one day?

Me: Nope. When it's time, I would no more trade Bitcoin for dollars than someone in Mexico wants you to trade your US Dollars for the Peso and pay them in that. They want USD. Bitcoin will become a world reserve currency eventually. It beats all other Fiat currencies. People will want Bitcoin over cash by 2030.

Normie: Nobody is using it as a currency.

Me: Incorrect. El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender. At least 5 other countries have followed suit. Russia recently switched to Bitcoin for international trade and to avoid sanctions. Unlike precious metals, they don't have to go through the process of shipping and protecting those rare metals, which is also time consuming. Bitcoin transfers in minutes and there is no worry about it being captured or seized in transit. For example: Recently Germany paid $9 Million to repartate $15 Billion worth of Gold from Paris. It took 5 years to move it, provide security for it, scan it with expensive machines to assure it was pure, not diluted or some of it filled with tungsten. 

Normie: Well, NFT's are a scam!

Me: NFT's are more likely money laundering schemes for the high priced sells. Someone has a bunch of shady money, they decide to launch an NFT and buy it themselves to clean the money, pay themselves, pay taxes, and make it all look legit in the end. NFT's as a technology is legit. It will be incorporated into ticket sales for sports and concerts and have countless other uses in the future.

Normie: The whole crypto scene will fail in the end.

Me: Pattern recognition and similarities between Bitcoin and the internet says no. All new technology, Internet and Bitcoin included, go through an ""I & S"" curve progression. They start slow, then become wildly popular and trendy so the price spikes before the technology, promises made, and development is ready for it. This creates a crash when there is nothing to latch onto and fall back upon. But the crash is short lived. Development continues. Apps are created. Games are built on it. Eventually it comes back up through the ""S"" curve upwards. Bitcoin has countless projects being developed for it. We hit the top of the cursive ""I"" and fell down to the bottom of the ""S"". And the S is 1,000's of times larger than the boom at the top of the ""I'. By 2030 Bitcoin will be wildly popular and cherrished as a reserve asset for all the reasons I specified above. I would not be surprised if a sign of great wealth is owning a single Bitcoin. Bitcoin was created as a currency, but became a reserve asset. Forks like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV maintain the currency aspect of Bitcoin through faster and cheaper transactions and a much larger blocksize. You are welcome to buy and spend those like cash.

Normie: I don't understand much of the technology you are speaking about, so it's a scam and I will seek out videos like this one to provide the confirmation bias I need to continue staying in the dark about all this.

Me: Ok. But it's very likely you will be unable to ignore Bitcoin in the future. It will be an integral to our lives as the internet, likely more as it becomes a universal world asset. And when you do purchase some when the price is vastly higher, please remember, ""you buy Bitcoin at the price you deserve.""

My 2 Cents,"A Bitcoin is created when a Math equation is solved by a computer.  Is that worth $20,000?  FTX and Binance both created their own coins.  They have no value until one is sold.  Then the multiply that price by the 20 million coins they created and like magic their coins at $100 each are worth 2 Billion dollars.  There are more than 20,000 different types of crypto coins.  Their true value is $0 but the scamers say the value is a based on what a willing buyer will pay a willing seller.  That might be true but when they create the willing buyer it is a scam.  So much money should be lost that the US government is looking for ways to legalize crypto.  The government wants to tax gains.  If crypto goes to $0 there will losses that can be claimed to offset income taxes.  The government will be the biggest looser.  That is you and me.",2023-01-15T16:40:40Z

But real talk, what will the price of Bitcoin be in 3 years or 10 years from now? If it's a Ponzi I expect you think it's going to zero. If it doesn't go to zero will you change your opinion? If it's worth more in three years from now will you revise your opinion?

You hit the nail on the head in the closing clip. If it's a ticking time bomb it will be worth zero in the coming years.",2023-01-15T12:01:51Z

The pure gospel on the flat earth,"There's lots of truth in this video, such as the fact that most crypto's will not really add fundamental value and are bought for their speculative value. Also it is true that many of the influencers are probably just paid to pump certain tokens. 
However, I suspect that the influencer making this video is probably also just paid by a certain financial institution to make the one competitor to the current banking scam look bad. It is cryptocurrency and you have several crypto's of which almost all tokens are on the market, which do a way better job in peer to peer payments then Bitcoin, but especially banks. 
Banks steal money from the public through their monetary policy, their legalized counterfeiting etc. They are virtually every day dumping their fiat on the public, also they are lending money out to governments to destroy real production and replace it by social spending and the banks have done this for over 100 years. Why aren't you outraged about this practice, you hypocrite?",2023-01-15T11:27:51Z

Second, crypto already have usecase. It allowing people to own USD and transact it freely within minutes, and even earning interest. There are millions of people in countries with dysfunctional banking systems that benefiting from it right now.
Third, argument about greater fool is silly. For example, people of Argentina are buying USD to flee from constatly detoriating national currency. Does it mean that they are looking for a greater fool to buy their usd later? Governments accumulating gold, does that mean that they are looking for greater fool too?

Huitzi Diaz,"I really love your film James, its very well made. I appreciate your point of view and narrative as it's all true and real, and helps spread awareness.
I understand most NFT's and Cryptos are scams and have no real reason to exist. 

In spite of this I just wanted to share why i currently utilize NFTs, and still find them exciting
As a musician I use NFTs as a way to sell my albums. i don't portray my NFT's as an investment, it's just a way for me to spread my music, and for people to support me similar to having a Patrion.
Like you said there was a lot of mania around the space, which during all the hype allowed me to easily spread my music to  a new audience. 
Smartcontract enabled me to create by own music marketplace without needing a third party
I Copyright my music first the conventional way, because as you said a smart contract is not law
I think the phrase ""Code is law"" is more a reference to the fact that we can deploy ""Solidity code"" on  chain without the need of permission. (this means a lot of scams will pop up) 
In some cases the code is unchangeable (immutable) once deployed, hence the phrase ""code is law"" although it may not be legal no one can stop you from deploying it and using it. 
Now of course there may be legal consequences as to why not to interact with these things. but technically there is no way to stop them.

I also just wanted to mention, you can utilize ""proof of stake"" chains  in order to be carbon neutral. ( i don't use any proof of work /mining incentivized networks)
 ""Zero-Knowledge Proofs"" allow for data to be stored privately on chain without IPFS.
""Zero-Knowledge Rollups""  allow for thousands of transactions to be bundled up and recorded as a single transaction and sent to another network inorder to be verified. (cross chain security)",2023-01-15T07:36:59Z

Finally we would be able monitor true government spending which is supposed to democratic and for the people.. But we the people don't believe it anymore. We need to watch our governments closely.

Lots of other uses but in my eyes that is the biggest advantage for businesses, and would help speed up the supply chain regarding funding, and save businesses collectively billions and billions of dollars.

Jorge Inojosa,"It's incredible how someone so smart can make such an extensive research and yet learn nothing, and masterfully paint this technology in the worst light ever...

First off, the title should be ""NFT: The World's Greatest Scam"", because it's pretty much centered around the subject. And to be fair, on that ground, the essay has some rock solid points.

But man, the ""terrible"" things ""exposed"" in this video, like pump and dump, ponzy shcemes, etc... Aren't crypto related they're human related. Yet, since crypto is so transparent and functional, it's actually very noticeable and detectable... Something that would be way harder with cash. This is one of many critical failures in the essay. The very characteristics of blockchain technology allow bad human behavior to be tracked and detected with ease. Specially compared to cash and securities.

Another fatal flaw, is ""demonizing"" the fact that people get into crypto as an investment and, at some point, some (if not most) of people, plan to ""cash out"". Well, flash news, that's how EVERY INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD works... You could even oxymoronicly say that in the end, people ""cash out"" even from cash itself, to buy land, goods, services, etc. And yet, wether you belive it or not, not everyone will 100% cash out of crypto. There are real applications, offering several solutions in this space, and cashing out completely, would be like selling Amazon Action's when they were a book store.

So yeah... Partially well researched video, way too centered on NFTs and labelling that as ""CRYPTO"" like it's the whole thing, while omiting critical concepts and areas like Decentralized Finance, Tokenization, Store of Value, and much more.

Lytchell,"It’s techno-fascism 

It’s about selling ‘libertarianism’ - which isn’t a political ideology. Libertarianism is a psychology - that is aimed at the ego and self myth making .

Crypto is a metaphor for Libertarianism. 

Libertarianism is…the Power pyramid scheme; hype and narcissism feed power to the top. 

The ultimate goal is to depopulate the globe.  Crypto fuels authoritarians and Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) - which pushes the mass wealth discrepancy as well as global poverty. 

Crypto accelerates climate change

Both fuel de-population. The world’s ultra elite and Uber wealthy can survive - and that’s what they want. 

They’re working on funneling all the money, power and resources to themselves…once national fall, they see themselves as the new nation builders where they create a world in their own image. 

Where they own the future…using all the tools , discoveries and creativity that they forcefully ‘inherited’

Justin Trudeau,The American dollar is also a ponzi scheme. The treasury prints a trillion dollars of worthless paper and then it only gets its value when the treasury sells bonds. This requires either more and more investors buying the bonds or requires the treasury to just print mote money which increases inflation. The only reason that the American dollar is worth anything is because America forces resource rich countries to believe the dollar has value through bonds so the usa can trade the dollar for valuable resources. It's insane,2023-01-15T00:15:11Z

Kael Kenner,"I'm a crypto native. And I can agree with 99% of the video. But, I don't think it's a timebomb.

Btw, one of the best video about the universe of crypto. It makes me think, and really have some responses to various of this questions.

But in resume of all: The technology it's amazing. It can really help in a lot of situations. What is wrong? The tokens.
For exemple, a Crypto game doesn't need of tokens. It can have Character and itens that are NFTs, ands that's can be trade in some place for the native token of the blockchain, or even for Stablecoins (and the company behind win some fees about it).

It has a lot to say, but not here. Maybe I do a video response this week. Maybe nobody will see, but thinking and working on it will help me to understand it too.",2023-01-15T00:00:18Z

riviera dental,"Just wow...the amount of people saying this is a well researched video and info is just beyond stupidity. I watched some of the other videos of this guy and i thought they were ok but after watching this video i have lost all respect for this guy. So he basically bet on the wrong horse and he lost money either with nfts or some shitty altcoin (because he didnt follow the DYOR rule on time) and now he is crying like a baby in front of the whole world saying Bitcoin is a scam?? I fucking dare you to compare Satoshi to the other founders of shitty crypto projects or celebrity endorsements or basically rug pulls.. you are not even worthy to talk about Satoshi when you obviously know nothing about Bitcoin.. most likely havent even read the white paper. I have no words to describe how misleading this video is, just trying to mix everything together like the Madoff scandal on Wall Street with crypto and Bitcoin... to give the appearance that Bitcoin founder Satoshi is just like Madoff and the whole thing is just a Get Rich Quick Scheme... because if that is the case then you tell me how many Bitcoins did Satoshi sell from his wallet when we were at the top of last bull run? Zero you fucking idiot. Does that look like a get rich quick scheme?? Huh? When all the bitcoins in Satoshis wallet (the very ""early investor"" as you would like to call him in your so called bitcoin get rich quick scheme) they just havent moved from that wallet in more than a decade... that would be the worst get rich quick scheme if you have to wait more than a decade to cash out. But obviously this dumbass never mentions this in his video because he knows nothing about bitcoin and Satoshi. And i could go on with all of the fallacies in this video... because seriously this guy just wants to sit comfortably in front of the camera and take advantage of his little fame and reputation to try to trash bitcoin when his knowledge and understanding has no comparison whatsoever with someone who went to MIT like Michael Saylor or someone who builds space rockets like Elon Musk... was someone as intelligent as Elon also  scammed into buying bitcoin?? Haha sure this pathetic influencer has more brains than Elon Musk or Michael Saylor.. yeah right. What is amazing though is amount os stupid people believing this kid and his very poor done research. This video is just about an angry baby whining in front of the camera that he fell for a rug pulled and lost money.. all because he didnt do a ""well reasearch"" before investing in whatever project or nft he lost money on. But to try to compare any of the scammers he talks about with Satoshi is seriously showing he doesnt understand Bitcoin whatsoever. He just made this video trashing Bitcoin because right now is a hot topic since we were just at the bottom of the bear market and he just wanted some views and monetize on them with whatever lies he could come up with. And just like he finishes his mediocre video... theres only one question left... whether in 5 years and 10 years and 20 years and 50 years bitcoin will be dead for the 400th time or if its value will be in the millions of dollars... thus making this dumbass and his video a fucking clown.

In this day and age online commodities like bitcoin actually have usecase for things like privacy, ease of transfer, protection against centralized over printing and other cases as well. Living in the west you may not think it so because your money holds its value pretty well like here in the US, but zoom your scope out just a bit and you will notice that the amount of people who would love an online currency that would actually hold its value properly over time, and let you send it to whom ever you want to, you may just see some of the use cases.

Welcome to WhateveR,"Just HODL ur btc and time WILL prove u wrong (if u dont believe in it just invest a small amount like 10% of ur portfolio into crypto. The current system we have right now is much worse. I agree tho with the NFTS, its the wildwest where people throw money on stupid pics, This CAN evolve into something much more important then pictures, it just need time to grow and find its place. NFTS are actually a very good system to proof your the owner of product X etc. There is alot to learn about both crypto and NFTs, And ALSO even more important try to understand our current system and you might realise what we have right now is much much worse. There is alot of scams going on within the crypto space so you need to be really careful and do alot of reasearch before you jump onboard. Its like buying a house, Do the reasearch before you buy, dont just jump onboard cous a friend told you about it. IF you understand the whole picture you will understand how good this system can be for alot of countries. 

You said: ""the only way to make money from your btc investment is to use money from new investors"". Thats LITTERALY HOW THE STOCKMARKET WORKS, its how everything works when it comes to trading stuff. someone sees it has more vaule than you do therefor he/she will buy it for a higher price. 

**The only good advice i can give is do your own reasearch, and do it well cous there is alot of information to take in.**

Your also missing out on some key information here, btc is not meant to be used as a everyday currencis its more of a store of value, But there is also a thing called lightning network which have much more transactions per second (it's built on BTC). Also ~60% is being mined with renewable sources of energy (Green energy), the number is also increasing every day which is good.  Im not a hater or anything i just want the information to be correct.

Snake Plissken,"Never liked the crypto stuff, nft´s are a complete worthless joke to me and so many people got scammed buying into either.
Like with any ponsi scheme those that bought in early made a lot of money, or potentially did, but only cause more suckers bought in cause of the hype... then once there is no more ""i*iot"" left to buy in.. it´s value is nosediving and there goes your investment. 

And don´t even get me started with this nft junk. Heck someone makes a low effort, cheap looking image, that gets just asset flipped with different cheap low effort skins over and over, and calls that ""art"" and somehow creates a hype ""it´s  worth a lot"". This crap has no actual use, no value, nothing, it entirely depends on what someone else would pay for it and if that someone else sees no value in it then you are stuck with nothing. But oh boy did all this junk opened the door for money laundry.

I hope people learned from that and don´t jump on the next, morally bankrupt celebrity backed scam. Be sceptical and ten times more sceptical if some rich human feces without any education wants to advertise it to you via social media.

Because of the general public's interest in crypto at the moment, there are a lot of vulnerable people out there playing with it and criminals know that.

Way more than BTC! And is eg. the banking system interested in saving energy? No. But  BTC mining facilities are in order to max the profits.

Yes, NFTs are trash. Know who i learned that from? Crypto experts, founders, and commentators. You’re not breaking any new ground or teaching anything that most crypto enthusiasts don’t already know. This exposes nothing.

With bitcoin, ethereum, hex, etc. I have borderless money that I can move across the world in seconds. Try doing that with dollars or precious metals.

The hope in buying stock is that the company will grow profits by outcompeting competitors.  Bitcoin has no profits.  It's not a company.

Proof of work??? In real world the proof of work IS WORK. REAL, PRODUCTIVE WORK: you work to produce something that somebody else want and that they will pay more than it costed to produce ! That has been and will be basic economy forever. Mining??? WTF IS THIS?? THIS IS NOT WORK, IT PRODUCES NOTHING worst, it's COSTLY, it is a complete and total loss , idiots! And what does it achieve?

""Money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants; money will not give him a code of values, if he’s evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if he’s evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his money.""",2023-01-13T16:04:52Z

No one in crypto will say that there are no scams in crypto. But you make it sound like as if therefore, the whole crypto industry is a scam. Why didn´t you say anything about the good projects? Why does a bank like Bank of America wants to partner with Ripple? Why does Wallmart China and BMW partner with VeChain? I can give many partnerships with different coins. Could it be that crypto actually has a usecase and that it does transform the way we do things? Why didnt you tell your watchers this? You just picked the scams out and therefore stated that the whole of crypto must be a scam. Its like saying the mistakes and frauds that are being made in the banking system make the whole banking system a scam. That is very weak.

The space grew allot in 10y and made allot more accessible but its still very experimental. Web 1.0 and 2.0 were created mostly behind closed doors in a 'centralized' way. The crypto space is not and that like you pointed out attracts indeed allot of greed. There is nothing wrong to experiment to make your vision work out. There are allot of problems that need to be fixed in the current web 2.0. The currency aspect built outside of the centralized ""offline"" world is one of them. The privacy concerns, the ad story and such. Web 3.0 has allot of solutions but its still very experimental everyone who would say otherwise is fooling himself.

Mario S.,"Sorry, this composition of Bitcoin, NFTs, ponzi schemes and scams is bullshit. Bitcoin cannot be a ponzi scheme. Because there's no central person or group profiting from it. And if nobody buys bitcoin, it will still not crash as it's not requiring fresh investments to stay working. ""One coin"" was a ponzi scheme. And we've seen it fall with its founders. Btw this never was a real currency nor had a real blockchain.
And ofc all these other ""crypto currencies"" ran by companies are bad copies that are obviously centralized by these companies making decisions. And this is the fundament of being able to totally fail by bad decisions of these companies. Bitcoin bleeds sometimes because it's being falsely connected with failing ""crypto currencies"" and bank-like organizations speculating and trading with units they don't really have.
But the only real, decentral Bitcoin ofc didn't fail. Its still on its course even under fire of critics who say all the ponzi-coins and failing trading platforms would be in connection. People are selling Bitcoin in panic because shitcoins fail or others lost theirs on bank-operator-platforms. ""Not your key, not your coins"".

The crypto space is a giant combination of a ponzi scheme, pyramid scheme, digital MLM, casino/game arcade. It just dawned on me where this whole thing is going.

With the ""introduction"" of web 3.0, blockchain tech and this metaverse that we keep hearing about, these are all building blocks towards building and kicking off operations in that metaverse. Essentially we will probably end up with the actual real world and a digital world simultaneously operating at the same time. Crypro, tokens etc will most likely be the currency there. There will probably be no free roaming anymore on the internet, you will probably no longer be able to access sites without a subscription... Its about to get darker that we ever imagined.",2023-01-13T10:50:50Z

cmfrtblynmb,"many of these celebrities are given free jpegs and they look like investors and supporters. They have nothing to lose, and if that jpeg becomes a few hundred thousand dollars, this is great for them. Some rich people buy a few NFTs, because for them it is chump change and they always buy anything that has the possibility of going up. They are rich, they can diversify their investment even by buying lottery tickets.

But the media is all like ""Hey, alllll these celebs believe in NFTs and they are the future"". First the get rich quick bros jump in. I don't have much pity for them. Then regular people think this is legit and they don't want to miss out. And some gets sucked in and spend all their savings. When they do that, the promoters of the NFTs cash out using these people's money. This is the ponzi part. 

This is indeed a sad story. There are guesstimates that show over 90-95% of people invested in crypto lost money. They fed the top 5%. This is worse than the financial system they like to complain about. This is pure evil.",2023-01-13T10:19:55Z

popkian,"You are wrong about bitcoin and I think you know it yourself. Bitcoin is a store of value not a currency. And people will spend it in exchange  for another asset such as a piece of land or a house etc. When ever they see fit.  There is no such a thing as intrinsic value! Gold does not have an intrinsic value. We the people give something an intrinsic value. Gold is valuable because to our human eyes it was shinny and it was hard to extract and used for jewelry couple of thousand years a go not because of its electrical properties.  To an alien coming from another world there are other elements that have superior electrical properties compare to Gold. Yet Gold is universally accepted as a valuable asset by humans. Bitcoin is becoming another asset or a store of value. You may not use it for your daily grocery shopping as you dont use gold for that purpose but imagine  two countries can settle a large transaction worth tens of millions of dollar in about 10 minutes, in a safe and decentralized manner without a need to rely on a single point of failure ( U.S. monetary system). Moreover this argument that Bitcoin is used by criminals for illegal transactions is nonsense. Most of the drug trafficking and many more crimes around the world is being done using dollar bills, have we banned dollar?! No. Guns in the U.S. are being used for all sorts of crimes, have we banned guns?! No!. Many criminal activities can be organized online using internet. Have we banned internet?! No!

SR1Records,"Seems like a lot of the NFT trades for big money is basically insider trading! And that's probably why crypto will never be regulated - because they don't want it regulated! 

I don't know about other coins, but you can make a bit of money with Bitcoin and Ethereum. You just need to be patient. I literally just sold some Bitcoin for a profit. Brought some about a month ago when it was valued at about 13K and sold it just now as it's currently valued at just over 15K. But it's just a bit of fun. You're basically risking thousands to win hundreds, or staking hundreds to wins 10s, if you know what i mean.

But you're not going to make a lot unless you're willing to risk losing a hell of a lot and tie up your cash for a long time!",2023-01-12T20:45:20Z

I mean in just recent days that crypto guy (one of ''em) Sam Bankman get arrested in the Bahamas and is now a home arrest until his trial. He's a Jew too. So beware of the Jews. Not be a hater or antisemitic but it shows. Just look at the last names those are the biggest giveaways. My advice to people is no such thing as easy ad quick money. It's okay to be chicken but play it safe. Maybe don't pay as much but you can have it when you want it.

HEXhibitionist,"Just found out, stocks are one giant Ponzi scheme. It relies on the idea that someone after me, arguably a bigger fool, will buy my stock at a higher price. 
There's real value behind stocks in the form of product creating and thus value creating companies? Think again. You don't own diddly squat with your share in a company. You cant decide what products they make, you can't get their products at a discount, you dont decide who they hire etc. etc. you dont even have posession of the actual paper documents.  The only way you see your 'ownership' go up in value if 'the next guy' buys them from you at a higher price.

And guess what, that has been working ever since the VOC issued the first ever companie shares in the 1600's! The market decides what has value.  The market decided crypto has value. Is there a lot of worthles sh*t arount there? You bet! A scammer's paradise. NFT's are a good example (as far as worhtless JPEG's are concerned) . 

You have to do you due dilligence and find the right projects. Securing life changing wealth in crypto is still possible, especially while we're in a bear market, thats where the wealth is created. Buy when there's blood in the streets and when videos like this appear to make you believe it's all a scam. The blockchain tech is indeed revolutionary and was made to get rid of middlemen. The opposite has happened the last decade, where the usual entities entered the field and once again took custody of peoples money and then loose it all in scams and mismanagement. True crypto, true DEFI will set you free for real, in more than one way. Crypto isnt going away anymore. FIND THE RIGHT CRYPTO. (Hence my avatar.)",2023-01-11T21:29:50Z

Aleksandar Kalaydzhiev,"I agree with the most but,

I would like to say you are nothing more than a slave in the modern world, thinking that whoever said anything is correct, without fact checking. Bitcoin is not about getting rich. Bitcoin is about Freedom.

US government is currently in 2 trillion dollars deficit for the 2023, plaining to raise it to almost 4 trillion. Meaning that they plant to spent 2 trillion more than what they will make. In other words, their objective now is to steal 2 trillion from the tax payers via inflation. 

But of course, this is legit, and you are talking that the only solution out of this slavery is scam. Shame on you. 

Not even going to argue with you, just saying that bitcoin has transacted more money in 2022 than Mastercard and visa combined. Talking about transactions per second, The lightning Network can make countless bitcoin transactions at the time with fees under a cent, while the banks tasks you with more a dollar sometimes. And all this technology is given to us for free.

The original intentions of the Bitcoin founder/s were good intentions from what I can gather. They were not out to scam people, they were out to create a fairer montary system. In that aim they have already achieved.. Bitcoin already does have a use case. This guy's hit piece uses the same old adages; Bitcoin proof of work uses to much energy, bitcoin is used by criminals etc... I heard all this before.

But just because a percentage of the crypto potential is used for scams, gambling and nonsense, doesn't automatically make everything else worthless. Crypto is helping people in multiple ways: from helping workers in third world countries to avoid the outrageous remittances fees,  to people in the middle of the Ukrainian and Russian conflict to flee the area and truck drivers in canada to protest within their rights after being locked out of their bank accounts, etc, etc. Summing that up to ""crypto is a scam cause there are some degenerates playing around with monkey pictures"" is very short sighted.

What isn't a scam though is the introduction of (DECENTRALIZED OPEN SOURCE) currencies that are traded for good services and even other currencies. The major differing factor being that there is no single person that can control the market for currencies such as bitcoin without committing an act of market manipulation which is highly ill-eagle whereas whereas scam coins, are made specifically to have a set group of people, (usually the person behind the coin and/or it's other beneficiary's) that are in control the coin in entirety giving them the ability to dump on the market stealing everyone's money.",2023-01-11T08:57:19Z

Baba Mama,"I agree with a lot of the talking points especially with regards to art NFTs being a big hype bubble but there are 2 key points I'd would argue against in the video. The first one being the problemwith BTC and other coins being inherently a ponzi scheme. The problem with this notion is that the ""ponzi"" narrative can be projected onto vortually any asset in existance. Gold isnt worth x amount of money because thats its real value, its what people believe its value is worth based on supply and demand. Same goes for other forms of assets like stocks and real estate. The other point of disagreement is with regards to smart contracts. Using peer to peer smart contracts for real world events like trading real estate is technically possible if the judicial system gives said smart contracts the legitmacy. In theory its even better than the system currently in place since its harder to forge documents, removes the need for a third party and doesnt even force you to meet in person. Any contract breach can be easily checked and verified the the digital ownership by said smart contract. And as far as the ticking time bomb goes, Im afraid the big dumpening has already happened.

eCash Germany - Community Channel,"Just go back to the basics. Crypto*CURRENCY* as described in the Bitcoin Whitepaper is a groundbreaking invention and absolutely an important one with civilization changing potential. 
Just because 99% of ""crypto"" and ""blockchain"" projects are now riding on the coat tails of this invention and normies who never cared for this invention until they realized they can ""get rich quick"" focus on those trashy scams, doesn't mean it is all just a scam.

There are differences between corporate ""blockchains"", nft tokens, web3 crap that doesn't work or has no purpose - and a real open-source public cryptocurrency that scales for super efficient, viable and instant transactions (and information) across borders without central point of failure in a trustless manner.

It's just that most ""supporters"" and their critics alike only look at those trashy, shiny BS projects, that labeled themselves crypto (note that currency is missing at this point - this is not a coincidence). And that corporate chains have billions to spend in marketing to get on TV shows. And those crappy NFTs that are so far gone from the original idea of cryptocurrency are banking on serving a nihilistic rich elite class of cokaine- and party addicts or soulless influencers, celebrities and tv stars that have no clue what they gotten into. All that does not make the invention of a trustless public ledger far from being worthless or ""a scam""",2023-01-10T21:02:19Z

What is the way out of those ridiculous sanctions? Bitcoin

So why are you calling Bitcoin a scam for doing the same thing the Stock Market has done for 100 years? In addition, if Crypto is a scam, why are companies like Starbucks and Visa building on Polygon and Ethereum?  Are they building on these crypto networks because they're a scam?  Bitcoin is the only Honest form of money or store of value that we have in the World.  Nothing is hidden about Bitcoin. Anyone can go on the. Internet and look at the Bitcoin Ledger.

Christoph,"52:29 ""We were already seeing very clear-cut use cases, even in those early days people COULD get weather reports, they COULD check the news, they COULD send emails and many other uses that we still use to this day."" 

Exactly, people could do that, but not everybody did at that time. Not everyone had the means to do it and by no means has it been adopted worldwide as it is today. 

The comparison is lazy, but it's exactly where we stand with Bitcoin today. People CAN (and do) use it as currency for trades. People CAN (and do) use it as a store of value. Just because not everyone is doing it (yet) doesn't mean it's a failure/scam.

I also think bitcoin mass hysteria ain't stopping anytime soon. The problem is bitcoin/Blockchain is like the Hitman that can blend in the crowd. It overlaps between coding and monetary thing. Its association with coding gives a risky credibility. It allows its proponents to say, ""look, it's all code, it's all open and peer to peer. Yada yada yada"".",2023-01-10T07:01:07Z

Ash Nair,"James, your editing skills, and music choices make me feel like I’m watching a YouTube documentary made by David Fincher. 

But I have to say, your choice of language, and bias point of view, like calling Crypto and Web3 fuelled by hype and delusion completely misses what makes it important. The current version of the internet and centralised finance desperately needs an alternative, even if it’s something as nascent as Web3. It is evolving technology and can only get better with time. 

Any kind of centralised structure, especially one that prints money whenever it wants to, is ripe for corruption and can never be a good thing. Web3 and crypto is not a perfect alternative but it’s a necessary alternative as there’s never been any pushback to the current centralisation status quo. Is it perfect? You obviously made some good points, even though the video was a hit piece that lacked journalistic integrity and never highlighted any of the positives with careful consideration. 
It’s pure propaganda that will most likely fool the non critical thinkers. 

Web3 and crypto will evolve, and some regulation is required to reduce overall risks and fraud. But most of the worlds financial fraud takes place within centralised banking institutions anyway. The free printing of money, political kickbacks in the trillions that are funnelled into shady shell corporations and paid to power brokers and politicians to fund proxy wars. Central banks are complicit to way more corruption than your ‘cryptobros’ but none of your videos ever highlight the real problems in the world. The problems that mainstream media doesn’t cover. Yet you attack a rising alternative that is breaking down some of the current power structures, which makes me have some suspicions on the hidden intentions behind this. 

I still commend you / your team, on your editing skills. The ominous background music really adds to the disturbing tone in your messaging. It’s almost too polished. With your skills, I’m surprised you’d rather make YouTube videos attacking grass roots movements like crypto and network marketing companies instead of putting your skills to make documentaries for any of the big streamers. 

Perhaps you could have shared how refugees escaping war torn countries got out of their dire situation with Bitcoin, or how ppl protesting against the government and got their banking facilities shut down survived on crypto donations, or perhaps the most important question of all, what financial alternative do people have to oppose a future social credit society that can shut your ability to buy basic necessities like food? I suppose none of these real world scenarios matter when all we care about are clicks.",2023-01-10T02:39:41Z

Well, traditional fiat currency is all Ponzi schemes also.  I thought the concept of BTC was that ""if we are all going to give in and use some Ponzi scheme for our currency, let's agree to not use one that gives more power to governments.""

Transactions are transparent and tracked in the blockchain for anyone to see. I wonder how many of its detractors will throw themselves to the ultracentralised CBDCs...

Why don't they wait to get even better tech for the same money in say 2 or 3 years? I don't think deflationary currency would mean little/less economic activity. And then tell me what is not a scam these days - property prices going up 20-30% in a year, or stocks values 5-10x to what they are actually worth? and now some crashing 70-80% from their ATH making people lose their savings, 401ks? Then look at most so called self-made millionaires - in most cases they also got rich in a ""lazy"" way - by investing into a right thing, very little people got rich from hard work. Anyway, I agree that most crypto is a scam but what is not these days. We are living in a crazy economy with too much money being around and doc like yours makes me wanna buy more now, as I think we are approaching  a bottom - i was looking for exactly these signs.

Even though I heard some people advise other people not to invest in cryptocurrency, I decided to do it anyway just in case it turns out to be legit. Like the vast majority of people, I already missed out on buying early crypto stocks that made people into millionaires, & I didn’t want to miss out on the opportunity to make good money.

Sule Man,"I am a cryptocurrency investor. When NFT's were a hype I doubted it thinking it was a pumped hype. I still invest in Cryptocurrency which has a utilitarian user case. Blockchain & Cryptocurrency is here to stay with ever growing global public interest and investment due to the fact that people are free to invest their valuables in what they independently chose. It's a digital asset but hey internet is digital, right? The fact that internet is digital would it lessen it's usercase value? Photos we shoot are digital mostly -not paperprinted. The messages we sent, the contracts we make, the business, government records are digital. What is digital? You never ask this - fundemantal question. Where digital takes its value from? What are its usercase borders, limits? You never ask these fundamental questions which are essential to define the present and increasingly emerging new reality. Blockchain, cryptocurrency is here to stay with increasing user cases and international public interest, investment. The value we attach to Gold and diamonds is subjective in its essence. The fact that blockchain & cryptocurrency is digital does not make it less valuable & dependable than gold or diamonds or government printed paper money. Its ""we"" who attach the meaning, value to these objects. Who can say or claim that gold or diamond has better usercase than blockchain utility backed cryptocurrency? NFT scammers, cryptocurrency scammers? Sure, they exist and they will exist as much as fake gold, fradulent diamond and paper money scammers exist. Does the fact that there are fake paper money, fake gold, diamond scammers invalidate the monetary system or gold, diamond markets? You need to ask questions again but this time impartially.
NOTE: Cyrptocatch words such as ""hodl, wagmi,  early investing, diamond hands"" which you criticize are valid investment principles applied and recommended by stock market investors such as multibillionarie Warren Buffet. Didn't you know this? Check your facts.",2023-01-08T19:01:50Z

In this ""Crypto"" system the assigned value of the currency is tied to nothing of accountable physical value thus it is like trading using a peice of collectible memorabilia or art as currency...the value is whatever the beholder/s feels it to be so. The fundamentals of currency systems is is simple...to standardize value so that a certain level in fair echange in goods can be ascertained (even this is not that perfect in regular currency-think agricultural vs tech products exchange)...so think what value does this form of ""crypto"" add to this kind of environment and what possible ways can it abuse the prevailing system or abuse itself for that matter.

The Xardas,I don't think Bitcoins or NFT are necessary evil things. It is more like a gun. Guns don't kill people. People kill people. Bitcoin actually in theory is a  very good thing it just not 60K a coin thing. NFT is kinda stupid in my opinion but also under certain circumstances can be useful and valuable. Not monkey pictures tho and not at that price but being able to keep digital art rights can serve a purpose. Again as long as it is not a subject of crazy speculation. Life is not black or white.

- Where is the mentioning of Bitcoin mining capturing methane?
- Where is the mentioning of utilizing stranded energy?
- Where is the mentioning of fiat money being the reason for overproduction?
- Where is the mentioning of Bitcoin giving everyone in the a bank?
- Where is the mentioning of the dollar loosing +99% of its value in just a century?
- Where is the mentioning of Bitcoin being the most secure computer network in existence?
- Where is the mentioning of Bitcoin mining incentivizing the renewable energy production as it's the cheaper energy source?

Where is the mentioning of the human race finally being able to break free of the monetary system which have made humans nothing but slaves.

Mr Bigs,"ah man I have been preaching the unpopular truth to people and they said I didn't know what I was taking about just because people managed to make some money. They would say things like I like to be negative or that I am a hater. Well I think like the great housing crises this will create a super crises like never seen before. it will leave a lot of people in situation the don't want to be in. like The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was instituted by the U.S. Treasury following the 2008 financial crisis.  the will be another TARP like policy to correct this issue. some companies and experts saw the housing market and toxic asset bubble but they new they were to big to fail and that there would be bailouts. The thing is this crypto market now would create bailouts for large companies that are invested in cryptos, NTF's and so on, but ordinary people will feel the stupidity of the mania.

History has many examples the Tulip mania and many more after that. Big companies have insurance for these things too, if insurance don't pay the government will create a relief bill.
bitcoin was meant to be cheap but it is now more expensive its failed its first use case.
number too if global warming is an issue it is the greatest threat, but you have to look at the fact that tech companies are selling tech hardware that have boosted profits. investors cannot call for a public execution of the goose that lays the golden eggs. some of them make profits on both fronts from the dividends that come from selling tech hardware and investing in cryptos. then think about utility companies and how much they make from these miners its insane.

I think people who have indorsed it and been at the forefront should  like the Winklevoss,Chamath Palihapitiya.

I believe you James Jani are one of the first Story tellers, Documentary Director/ artist and influencer to really deliver the sober truth to people, and i believe many should follow suit. The American government the FBI, CIA, NSA and other government related agencies can find anyone anywhere and we are supposed to believe the narrative they cannot find Satoshi Nakamoto.",2023-01-08T07:14:02Z

I hate to use buzzwords but you've got to admit that having something that can move value from one side of the world to the other in a few minutes with no third parties is something huge. The only real future crypto has for mass adoption stands in decentralized stable coins and privacy: we all know about Terra/Luna, but that project showed us that something like that is actually possible and scalable.

The world is becoming more and more Digital everyday. Fiat currency is not the answer. Fiat is an Analog Technology for a Digital World. We need a Digital Currency. Perhaps its Ethereum, or some other altcoin, or maybe CBDCs. But whatever the currency of the future is, i guarantee you one thing, it will be ""backed"" by Bitcoin. Imagine if you were an early adopter of Gold? Wouldn't you hold it as long as you can?

Then the NFTs came about, and not knowing much about any of it, I just realised that it meant “non fungible token”… which means this is, again, the exact opposite of currency once again. And the pics associated with NFTs aren’t even the actual NFTs. People are literally buying a computer ledger entry for money… as a flex.

But the things that people are claiming are a Ponzi scheme, such as Bitcoin, do not meet any of the criteria to actually be a Ponzi Scheme.  Literal Ponzi Schemes are actually fairly rare.  Bitcoin, undboutedly, is not a Ponzi Scheme in the literal sense.  If it were one there is no way that the CME, aka the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, would have listed futures for Bitcoin.  Anyone who I hear screaming that something is a Ponzi is almost always advertising their own ignorance.  Just go and look up the basic definition, read up on the history of the first Ponzi scheme, and learn about the critera that must be in place for something to qualify as being one.",2023-01-08T00:58:57Z

You HAVE TO be patient to see it on the profit AGAIN (happened multiple times) as the past has proven us that each bear period is naturally followed by a bull.

Yet believing in an immortal circle is kinda naive in our fragile economy world. Surely I do believe every system eventually comes to an end, but it is like claiming that capitalism will die soon, like it is just a matter of time.

Thecat66666 Thecat6666,"You asked what the use case is for crypto, and the only answer I can give you is ""illegal content"". 
Honestly I feel like the whole investment aspect of crypto is its biggest fundamental flaw. This stuff has the potential to increases security and/or anonymity for users, I mean, that is the whole point of decentralizing stuff. 
When you have a dispute between 2 people, a non-bias 3rd party can help resolve a conflict, like a judge/jury in a court case. But what do you do when the 3rd party has a bias? you get fucked. Decentralization is the attempt to eliminate bias from the 3rd party or to eliminate the 3rd party as a whole. It also protects users from a 3rd party forcibly involving themselves.

Now that is pretty dam cool, but it opens up a whole new can of worms. Illegal activity becomes a whole lot more feasible. And I believe that the blockchain's major flaws have gone and completely overtaken the technology. To be honest, in a future where the block chain is a fundamental technology in humanity, none of this investment nonsense will be a part of it, or if it is, then it will be compartmentalized. 

 while I do believe that some things need a 3rd party due to our inability to predict every possible conflict that may occur, I also wish for the day whare the internet is a little more free and equal than it is now. I believe blockchain technologies is one of the fundamental technologies to achieving that goal. As it is now, it's not even close, and this investment crap is leading the tech astray.",2023-01-08T00:19:17Z

Section 7,"Satoshi Nakamoto was CIA and all the crypto ""mining"" was data processing for the Large Hadron Collider. They knew they would need a massive network and began planning in 98 using new and existing ideas and concepts, such as e-Cash idea from the 80s (or e-Cache in reality). As LHC began experimenting, the data that needed to be resolved was outsourced to the crypto ""mining"" networks. Easier to pay monkeys to do the work and deal with overheads and maintenance than build the world's biggest most expensive data processing plant. Now quantum computing and soft matter data storage has evolved to the point of replacing worldwide networks into a single room which makes all the monkeys redundant.

Or like when people thought a cell phone capable of taking pictures was just a gimmick because why would anyone want a phone that takes pictures when we already had digital cameras to take pictures.  Most people couldn't see the potential . 
And now we have crypto and just like before people can't or don't want to see the potential of Blockchain.  Just the fact someone can transmit value to anyone virtually anywhere in the world 24/7 in a matter of seconds with a cost of mere pennies per transaction, while also  having the potential to eliminate the use of  central banks and their scam of creating $$ out of nothing, lending it to the people and their govts , charging interest on the loans and then using this ability to manipulate the economy through inflation and control the population with debt and then taking control and amassing huge amounts of physical assets and leaving the general population broke and enslaved to the banks which ensures they continue to maintain control of damn near everything - is huge! 

 a bankster once said ""give me control of a nation's money supply and I care not who makes the laws""   
and so here we are being fudded about crypto as a whole by directing the publics attention to and placing the focus mainly on ridiculous NFT art while remaining silent and conveniently ignoring the the very real potential of cryptos ability to free mankind from the control of the banks and our  enslavement to their debt based monetary policy.

So how do we remove the blockage of the banks so we can do business, if crypto is ""like you say"" just a scam?!?",2023-01-07T16:59:53Z

Simob7,"You could have bought in another angle too. There are legitime use cases for crypto. Outside of buying drugs, too.

However its a very good point that the whole crypto game (tokens, alt coins, nft's) was pushed to the mainstream and beyond by a single motive. How to make as much money as possible out of those. And especially Fiat money. How ironic that the ""dollar is going to be doomed and cyrpto is the new way"" was to bump and dump all possible variations of tokens and NFT's just to get more of Fiat money. Nothing to do with power to the people when VC'a fund your tokens. Without regulation that's worse than Gov greed.

Basic human greed took a great idea and concept such as bitcoin and turned it to ""how do maximize my own winnings above everyone else's by any means nesseccary"" - a bummer.",2023-01-07T07:25:19Z

A few times i noticed you intentionally kept somethings surface leveled because going in depth in the matter would actually prove some of your points wrong, which i get really, the video is pushing the scam narrative.
We all know crypto is a scam, the whole monetary system is one. Crypto will fall first but it will never disappear completely because it will always have use cases (not referring to illegal activity)until it is completely banned.
The blockchain will always have use for some. It is honestly good tech, sad that it has been attached to this whole culture of ponzis/scam coins masked by the overflow of euphoria of people making easy money.

Also a few hours of research and a calculations it becomes blatantly obvious that crypto is now mathematically too big to disappear and not have severe impacts on our economy. Sure a shit tone of people will lose money and crypto will hit a plateau, but it will never disappear. the ticking time bomb will never blow but simply stop ticking.

bspus,"There is a lot of truth in your film. Most of the media coverage, even within the crypto scene is indeed about scammy projects or far fetched ideas that are doomed to fail.
However I still see a lot of value in bitcoin specifically. Not as digital cash but as digital gold. There is a large percentage of people in crypto (mostly called bitcoin maximalists) who see this as the main use case for bitcoin and consciously choose to separate themselves from the rest of the crypto space. In fact it is a glaring omission that you didn't mention this whether you agree with this position or not.
There is also the case of layer 2 solutions like the lightning network which could address scaling and fees issues to a point where it could be worth reconsidering the use case of payments sometime in the future. But we are certainly not there yet. Regardless, it would also have been worth mentioning.
Those are the very things that fly over the head of most crypto new comers. They find this stuff boring when indeed that is the true innovation. A potential worldwide settlement layer that is decentralized and fully digital. But no, people want to hear about get rich quick ponzi schemes implemented with a blockchain. Sad... but I consider the ""revolution"" far from over.",2023-01-06T18:20:25Z

You see, we always tend to considerer scammers those who speak in favor of putting money here or there (basically because they promote their own projects), when we end up loosing the money invested, but what about the people who discouraged us from buying this or that and then it goes well?

The reality is that it is a revolutionary technology, so its useful case is going to blend with current money system in some ways or another. I don’t believe that people are decent to use money without any regulations the same way as I don’t believe government should have too much power on people’s personal money.

Lloyd Diliz,"I'm a reasonable believer of the potential of the cryto technology and skeptic at the same time. I don't see it as a get rich quick scheme in anyway. I was genuinely interested to see what I could learn from this hour long video but all you did is make a list of scams that were run on the back of the hype that goes around the cryptosphere, with dramatic music and effects. Your case for how it is a giant Ponzi if barely backed by evidence. The main piece of the video revolves around nft which, of course, just like the art market, is a highly manipulated market. Nothing new. Of course there is a bubble of overinflated prices because there is a hype and scammers will jump on the opportunity. There is a lot of naive reasoning like the comparison between a smart contract and legal contract. Of course its different and the saying ""code is law"" doesn't actually suggest that (I won't elaborate. DYOR if you want to understand what is actually meant by that). Granted, you do a good job at making a compilation of various dodgy characters and scams (which have already been called by others like coffeezilla) and dissecting some of the more toxic traits of the cryptosphere culture but on the whole, there aren't many of your claims that actually backed by much more than anecdotal evidence, if at all. That doesn't make for a strong case supporting the big claim of the title. It just sound like those conspiracy theory documentaries. There is an interesting theory that is proposed but it's very weakly backed. In the end, for all I know, you might be right but if you are, it will merely be by luck.

a product that makes the company worth anything, so the vallue of bitcoin is what we all think it's worth, so it's like the tulip craze a few hunderd years ago 
in holland. Tulips are worth pennies but some people back then thought it was worth way more so other people started to buy tulips aswell because when
everybody starts to buy them for alot of money, then it must be worth something is what the followers thought, so more people started to buy tulips and
payed a ton of money like the value of their house! But then someone started to sell his tulips for waaaaaaaaay less and then the next seller started to
sell sell sell for less and less and in the end tulips were worthless and alot of people lost everything they had.
Well, i have crypto's but i only invested money that i can affort to loose, and hope that this scene will go on for a while and prices go up again
and then take my share and then get the hell out of crypto's because when i make a profit, then others will loose theirs, so it's all about acting fast and first

Sure, gold has some real life usability, but the majority of bought gold is investment in some form, the same type of speculative investment like you are explaining in this video about Bitcoin. One buys it in a hope to sell it for more in the future, or as an inflation hedge. The only real difference is, have you ever tried to sell gold? Try it, because it sucks. Have you ever tried selling Bitcoin? Its Easy and you can do it via your phone. Comparing Bitcoin to NFTs is like comparing apples to oranges, the only thing they have in common is the blockchain tech on which they operate, everything else is different. 

Just think at it like this. If people are willing to buy an apartment on Manhattan for 1.5billion as a way to hedge their money, how many buyers would there potentially be? Wouldnt it be Nice to be able to fractionalize that asset in order to sell it more easily?",2023-01-06T08:20:24Z

This thing ran the exact course it was always destined to.

And blockchain is nothing but a Merkle tree. A cryptography finger exercise that has existed since the 70's and that has severely limited application, because it scales poorly and it's irreversibility makes it almost wholly useless for most real world use cases.

Hammerhead547,"""at what point does the ticking time bomb go off""

I think it already has, considering how the crypto market all but imploded last fall and how regulators/auditors who are looking into ""companies""  like binance and a few of the other really big crypto ""exchanges"" and they're finding out that the books those companies keep are shall we say ""charitable with the truth"" when it comes too token value, holdings and overall leverage (never mind the fact they've already found several hundred accounts that are clearly owned by known terrorists, terrorist organizations and international criminals/criminal organization) I'd say that the fuse has already been lit, it's just one of those delayed detonation devices that is designed to go off in stages rather than all at once.

I'd say by the end of this year the crypto market and everything else associated with it will be completely vaporized wiping out all of the ""investments"" people put into it, and the best part is: because its a completely contained market that only a few hundred thousand terminally online idiots partake in the implosion will destroy them but won't hurt anyone that actually matters.",2023-01-06T06:45:11Z

Daresto8,"It's important to recognize that the US dollar, like many other fiat currencies, is not backed by a physical commodity such as gold. Instead, it is backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, which has the ability to issue new currency as needed. This means that the value of the US dollar is subject to fluctuations based on a range of factors such as inflation, market demand, and economic conditions.

In contrast, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any single organization or government. This decentralization can provide some benefits, such as increased transparency and reduced potential for manipulation or interference. Decentralization also means that no single entity has the ability to issue new currency or to control the supply of the currency, which can help to maintain the value of the currency over time.

Overall, while both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies have their own set of drawbacks and risks, it's important to consider the potential benefits of decentralization and to make informed decisions about where to keep your money.",2023-01-06T06:10:47Z

For as much lip service as the powers that be pay to ""democracy,"" it is not because they believe in it on principle. ""Democracy"" as it exists in the modern world is a tool meant to pacify the populace into accepting any amount of abuse and oppression under the guise that if one doesn't like the abuse and oppression they've suffered under the rule of one party, one can simply ""vote them out."" In practice, it is evident that substantial change in favor of the populace never materializes within the confines of this system no matter what any ""influencer,"" celebrity, or politician (all cults of personality which serve as proxies for ""democracy"" at large) promises.",2023-01-06T05:30:17Z

For context I’m in a marketing business of 50 people and we transact crypto everyday.

Not A Retail 212 Male,"Crypto isn't a scam, it's just that many of you simple refuse to do ANY kind of research before you jump head first into a sector where you clearly have no understanding of what is going on. 

I'm sure many of you will disagree, but the reality is when you look at what projects have failed, ask yourself this; why exactly are people jumping into these ""new"" projects, schemes, lending ideas, blah blah blah when there is realistically only ONE coin you should be considering.

And what is this ""coin"" you might ask? It's not Litecoin, it's not Ethereum, it's BITCOIN. NOT ridiculous ""defi"" schemes, not projects backed by shady VC's, not exchanges ran by a person who is the second largest donor to the democrat party, not meme coins, not NFT's ( how anyone fell for buying pixel at is beyond me), I could go on and on.

If you are reading this and you have lost money in the last year, YOU lost because you became greedy and chose to chase after shady projects to make a quick gain, not because crypto is a scam. I know this because I have been in this space for a very long time, in the good and bad times, and the people who always complain in the bad times are ALWAYS the people who make the WORSE DECISIONS.

ONLY buy Bitcoin. When you buy Bitcoin, keep it on your OWN personal wallet, NOT on an exchange. If more of you focussed on the only coin that makes sense, maybe you would make some money instead of losing your entire life saving.

And before anyone tells me you can't possibly buy Bitcoin, it's too random, you never know when to buy, blah blah blah, watch this: When Bitcoin crashed from 20K the first time, why did it crash? When the ETF launched, right? So when Bitcoin crashed AGAIN from the 65 - 70K range, what launched? Oh wait that's right yet another ETF yet so many of you are soo blinded by greed that you missed the key selling signal.

I could honestly go on and on but if you have made it this far, hopefully you get the point. Stop calling everything a scam, do your research and you will be this fine, and to be honest ( and this is my personal opinion ), I am glad all of these things have happened so you people can finally focus on Bitcoin instead of fluff.",2023-01-06T00:39:00Z

Saint MTE,"Guys, just so you're not wrong footed by this video...

Bitcoin has no utility and those that have done proper research know this, hence why it is called crypto gold.

Now, there are a few (not many) cryptos with utility that solve REAL world problems. This means that 99% of cryptos WILL go to zero and be erased from existence.

If you think otherwise then ask world governments why they've adopted only certain cryptos into their financial tech plans for the future. These cryptos are in LEGAL documents found on the official websites of some major financial institutions.

Look up ISO 20022 and come back to this comment.

P.s. again, this video is on point (when isolated to Bitcoin) but is moot when describing cryptos with *UTILITY*",2023-01-05T23:26:49Z

Please do more research. This video is a terrible representation of what Bitcoin is. You need to put more time into researching the beauty of Proof-of-Work mining for Bitcoin. You basically have not done any research into how the US dollar was created and all of the terrible things that fiat causes.

Stefe,"The only way that bitcoin will work is if the majority of businesses actually process payments in bitcoin (not converting BTC to USD/some real currency), that way it actually has value. But since everything today you have to convert BTC to USD/currency its basically  worthless in the long run. But thats how it goes for everything in life. You cant just expect something to have value if it doesnt provide something for YOU. The true value in investing is investing in stuff that provides something for the owner. Companies have stock and you can invest in them but those companies have value and hold value because they offer some service that people want to buy because of that service, if people buy something just because its ""worth something"" at some point it becomes worthless. People should be educated more about how money works and just think logically, the only true poeple who profit are the lucky few who buy early and sell when the hype is at the peak (basically a pump&dump scheme)",2023-01-05T21:26:52Z

There is genuine use for crypto which doesnt hurt people or the world, but its just not worth the hundreds and thousands of cashgrabs and rugpulls.

I totally agree that the current state of NFTs are bullshit, but the idea of proven ownership is good.

Also, computer code that is immutable is better than human decision that is highly corrupt able when it comes to laws.

Currently, there is only Bitcoin and Ethereum (maybe). Everything else is 99,99% garbage.

DougManyole,"If anyone ever wants control of their own 'money' then crypto is the answer. It empowers people, it takes control of your money away from the banks and gives it to you. People get into crypto because someone prompts them to, make some money 💰  and then they do a litte research and some realise its potential and what it's really built for and that's it. It fixes so many issues that you be 100% sure it's an industry that isn't going away. 
Bitcoin was made as a store of value. Other cryptos will become a currency. Also Crypto mining allows the green energy infrastructure to be built on the first place for many countries. Geothermal, wind, solar and hydro are all the cheapest energy sources and so that's where the miners will go to mine. The money they pay subsidises the cost of the plants being scaled up for whole communities to use. Its as green as it gets 

There will be scams and bad players along the way.",2023-01-05T18:24:00Z

I must admit I did at one point explore crypto back when it was all new, but even then I really could not find a use case or even a proper sense of value in my everyday life.  It's entirely speculative. NFT's were ridiculous, and the people who bought the NFT of the book about Jodorowsky's Dune actually thought that they owned it outright.  They got laughed out of existence when people explained how copyright works, and how it's irrelevant to ""ownership"" in the sense that they thought they had.  How people stay on this bandwagon despite the scams, the ""get rich quick"" mentality of it all and the rug pulls that seem to happen constantly, along with SBF's arrest is beyond me.

Khalil Khoury,"Bitcoin is NOT crypto, intellectually disingenuous.",2023-01-05T17:46:37Z
Neehize,"Crypto is neither a ""scam"" nor ""the next big thing"". At its core, the blockchain is just a technology that can be leveraged to build decentralised entities like banks or authorities. The people who bought BTC from 2009 to 2015 understood this and invested in it for what it really was.

It all started to go haywire around 2017-2018 when people started to realize they could use crypto as an investment asset. These people either completely ignored what crypto real was (FOMO) or speculated about what it could become in the next few years. As a result, tons of money got poured into crypto, and obviously, where there is money there are scams and there were indeed quite lot of scams in crypto.

Just like with any stock exchange, some people got rich, some people got poor, but in the end no value was created. What's more, most people still have no idea what crypto is. The people who call crypto a scam are either the same people that blindly invested in it or the people that think the people who invest are being controlled by a higher entity.

From my point of view, the core of the problem is that we (the people) need to do better when it comes to investing our money. Educating people on how to invest would let them take their responsibility and stop crying when they lose their money or screaming ""scam"" to anything they invested in that didn't work. Again, crypto in itself is not a scam but yes, there are a lot of scams in the mix.

Personally, I never invested in crypto and I still think it's well overrated for what it really is today, especially BTC who is a dinosaur crypto that doesn't scale at all and that isn't even worth $1 in my mind. If fiat banks were to collapse I would rather buy gold. But who knows, maybe in the future I will buy crypto instead.

A good project should incorporates Governance,  Decentralization, Scaling and Smart Contracts/Communication. Most, if not all the projects you mentioned lacked all of these. I find it troubling how a majority of your video focused on NFT's when to a real Blockchain enthusiast, NFT's are droplets in an ocean.

Dinos,"Pyramid schemes. A story as old as the sun. The cryptos remind us of just any other banking/investing pyramid scheme. The NFTs remind us of the... Dutch tulips! If anyone knows the history of the Dutch tulips he understands : the tulip was not a Dutch flower originally. The flower itself comes from Minor Asia (the region of modern-day Turkey). So, back in the Ottoman era, in the mid-1600s, a Jewish merchant who traded between the Ottoman Empire and the Dutch state and who also served as a diplomat, he saw tulips and loved the flower. So he brought some back to Netherlands to impress people. People loved the flower so much that a whole trade was set to import tulips from the Ottoman Empire. Since cultivation of tulips had not yet set in the Netherlands as the plant has to be accustomed to the northern weather and humid soil, there were so few tulips that their price was exorbitant. Which, as one now would expect, attracted investors who started investing in... tulips! Mind you, we don't mean ""tulip futures"", they were literally investing in tulips, the very flowers. How long does a tulip live? If you cut it, how long does it live fresh? Well... people were diving in and buying tulips like crazy. This was the 1600s, and the Netherlands had recently become the richest part of Europe after Venitian (very often of Jewish ancestry) bankers had moved there from Venice -  they were divesting from Venice and investing in the North, namely in the Dutch and British East/West India Companies (the very reason why you keep seeing translations of Venitian names and Venitian-inspired flags). So people, surfing on the affluence and promise of an even wealthier future were diving in to invest. There was the case of a rich widow who during a dinner ended up buying a single tulip at the price of a new house!!! All that just before the ponzi scheme collapsed.... the price of tulips dropped ot the bottom of the sea as soon as people realised what a pyramid scheme it was and everyone woke up from the smoke and fumes of the tulip crazy, realising that it is just an effing flower, not gold or silver or copper. 

Honestly, I believe the NFTs to be an even more ridiculous ponzi scheme than the tulip.",2023-01-05T17:14:12Z

Based off the ability to buy a house you can’t afford, the housing market is a scam.

Based off the inability to access all the money you have, the banking system is a scam. 

Every idea that is ever created could be considered a scam, because realistically, there’s always winners and losers.

Now is there scamming in the crypto world? 100%

Is there scamming in the real world? 100%

What crypto can do is very simple: revolutionize the banking world.

Decentralization, bank the unbanked, self custody, trustlessness, deflation, just to name a couple. bitcoin is not about how much dollar its worth, because the dollar is the illusion that we all agree on. But it is controlled and i quote another catchphrase that you missed. ""The money printer goes brrrrrrrrrrr"" they increase the supply however they want. And the world is how it is, if there is money to be made, bad actors will show up. Try to controll and squeeze out every the last bit. Bitcoin is only a tool, what we do with it is in our own hands. It is the single most important tool in our lifetime if we want to be free. Think of Cbdc, goverment oversight will be massive. If you dont fit in their view, you simply get canceled. Push of a button. Done. I cant stress this enough. However back to your video. I dont disagree, there have been a massive misunderstandings, scams, loopholes, rugs, bubbles, moneygrabs and devastating losses. Winners and loosers.

Cause we have been banned on swift or commission skyrocket to 3-10% of your sending. So use usdt to pay for smt much easier. If u live in a country that hated by so much people it's a chance to international trades. Don't need go to bank or smt use decentralized services and everything going nice.

Mojitotech,"I beg to differ. 

Bitcoin, given its deflationary and limited supply mining characteristics, is actually a transactional commodity. Think of it as a form of intangible and easily accessible digital gold where the price of a bitcoin is actually based on basic economic demand and supply principle. 

Yes, I do agree that majority, >90% of the cryptocurrencies have no legitimate use case and they are more of a money grab. However, there are still valid use cases to some of the projects. 

As for NFT(s), indeed there was a hype surrounding it and the hype has probably died down. But, you gotta realise how NFT has transformed the art world in terms of verifying and validating the authenticity and ownership in just a matter of a couple of clicks. The use case is still strong and I do believe that NFTs are here to stay and could even extent beyond arts for e.g. National Identity verification, Mortgage ownership etc.

What this space and industry TRULY Needs is clear and tight regulations surrounding the creation, promotion and custodian of cryptocurrencies. I firmly believe that regulations will bring greater clarity and protection for all stakeholders in this space and will act a form of deterrence against bad actors. 

If crypto is a total sham like you said, which I highly doubt so given that various high net worth individuals, banks, boutique firms, sovereign wealth funds are investing millions and millions dollars into the development of the space and crypto related products.  I highly doubt they will pour millions to billions of dollars into something that doesn't provide a decent ROI.",2023-01-05T12:55:03Z

Timothy Swan,"I was a studied computer scientist who understood algorithms when I read them before bitcoin was released.

When I finally saw how cryptos worked, I immediately knew ""oh yeah, it works just ike Star Wars credits"" and was happy to see that a legit currency (instead of fiat) was finally made.

Then I loved how NFTs could prove you had a file at a particular time (to show a contract or an invention).

When people starting buying cryptos on centralized exchanges and claiming that NFTs are scams because they were minting images (you can change an image slightly and it will have a different NFT) in order to ""trade"" ownership of said image, I figured these were just a few people who didn't know what they were doing. Duh, of course if you treat a currency as only an investment and not actually use it for its purpose: to trade, it is the same as if I made an ""Empty Company, Inc"" and had stocks invested into it.

Now people think crypto itself is a scam? LOL It's just a legitimate data structure and the only reason it took off as a currency is because the data structure works so well it actually functions better on its own than if a bank or company were trying to emulate it. Crypto itself is no scam. It's completely surrounded and veiled with scams and social insanity just like gold and oil was. That doesn't mean that gold and oil are scams, it just shows how legit they were as the ""things"" they were.

JurnellGaming,"I watched many of your vids and I usually love the work you do but this one here wasn't fair and just. 

Associating NFTs and NFT scams to Bitcoin is unfair of you. Your aim seems to be to defame bitcoin and the amazing blockchain projects out there.  Associating criminal activities to crypto when ciminal activites also are done using fiat isn't a good argument to make. Crypto has saved many countries around the world finantially and many ppl still use it today as a store of value and to send to their family and friends, especially in non first world countries. 

There are amzing things being build on the blockchain. Pointing out scam projects makes no sense cause scammers are everywhere and in every industry.

-Many mining rigs are using renuable energy sources rn and many crypto projects don't even rely on mining. 
-The production and use of fiat uses extream amounts of resources, including energy.
-Money that can be printed out of thin air isn't as valuable as something that is finite, cannon be controlled and you can see a history of all transactions. 
-The value of the dollar has gone down and is continuing to go down. Bitcoing from 2009 to today is up and will continue to rise for a pretty long time

wugy07,"Crypto currencies are a revolution in the sense that we can actually create a commodity based currency that is entirely bound by energy consumption. This is truly the revolution that Friedrich Hayek envisioned, a commodity based currency that is backed by something more valuable than gold.

However every revolutionary idea gets initially manic by the charlatans, until the idea is allowed to permeate the minds of the stoics.

Cryptos are a revolutionary idea, but what we currently have, is a free for all by people that don't understand how to earn a modest living.

That will change, as Hayek's work is still to this day, way ahead of its time. Peace through trade? We're not there yet when we have a government that profits from war.",2023-01-05T07:39:18Z
sunilshah-cape-town,"'There are more examples of bubbles and crashes that lead to vast value, none more so than the Dotcom boom and crash.'

I find it so amusing when crypto fans broadcast booms/busts in equity markets as a justification for similar events in crypto.

You don't seem to see the boom/busy in equity was grounded on wildly bullish/ bearish assumptions about :TAM, forward earnings/prospects discount rates etc of the entity, to arrive at the (dynamic) underlying intrinsic value of the equity.
Whereas what's the intrinsic value of bitcoin? 
Zero, that's the underlying extra utility of bitcoin vs an alternative payment medium .  

The price is predicated PURELY on the greater fool who's willing to pay more for it.

Did you see the difference?",2023-01-05T07:33:27Z
M.J. Ford,The so-called person that created bitcoins was probably a CIA operative or not.  They have an AI that can predict the flow of the market with complete accuracy. This way people won't lose big money in the stock market. Jim Rickards talked about it among some other stuff I know people have seen his ads about how to protect yourself because of the new bill that Biden created without anyone knowing. This bill would give the government control over everybody's money if they don't like something that you use your money for like a certain calls that they are against and what not they can turn it off. This means that the US Fiat will be no more and it will be a crypto in its place.,2023-01-05T07:29:36Z

Rens Tillmann,"It doesn't change the technology. All these people just invested money without knowing how things work. They put lots of money on central platforms. Then you just really have no clue what you are doing. The point is to be decentralized. Even though it might not be 100% possible. It's meant to be as close as possible. There are a lot of cool things being worked on. This is all part of the growing pain. People will learn. Just like people still learn about scams on the regular internet like phishing emails and what not. There are always scams no matter what or where. But at least YOU are the one in FULL control over your ""money"". The thing with blockchains are that they require a ""token"" to function. What it's use case might be depends. And as an example it might even change (Bitcoin for example). Also there are always different types of people. Some are afraid to take risks, some take to much and might be careless. But that's ok. It's your own life, you decide your next moves. As a passionate developer I do not even follow the news to much about blockchain/crypto space. I only follow three projects, one being very closely. I am not going to name them here. I know how that ends up in pointless endless ""discussions"". I do me, you do you. It's a ""free"" world depending on your geo location. Me myself, I just look at the tech and what I believe to be valuable for/from a developers point of view. And with value I am not referring to money wise. I didn't like NFT's, never will. Some others will. And that's ok. You are at least free to do with your money as you wish, without anybody monitoring/knowing it. Is that worth anything to you? This again depends on you as a person. It's never as black and white. As long as you are passionate about whatever it is you are passionate about, you will be happy. And the rest is just a nice +1 to your life. Good luck to all in 2023 and may your wishes come true! 🥂",2023-01-05T06:19:52Z

Web 3.0 was introduced to me in 2022. I discovered Metis, Optimism, Deso, adshares, and many other web 3.0 crypto that gave me hope for the future. Unfortunately, 2022 also revealed a dark and sinister side of crypto starting with Bitcoin falling, Luna crashing to 0 and ending with Sam Bankfreeman's arrest after the collapse of FTX . This caused Solana to fall. I hope that the story of crypto does not end with the next crash of the economy",2023-01-05T06:06:39Z

Double spending

Fraud

Lack of trust

Middlemen

Centralization

Lack of transparency

Inefficient processes

High transaction costs

Long transaction times

Lack of security for transactions

Lack of ownership records for digital assets

Difficulty in verifying identity

Lack of interoperability between different systems

Difficulty in enforcing contracts

Inability to easily transfer ownership of assets.

Don't listen to this guy, every concept has its pros and cons, he's only focusing on the bad side. Eventually Crypto is the future.

That was Satoshi's ideia.

In Brazil everytime one buys a house from another, or when one inherites a sim of money, the government takes a huge bite of it's price through taxes. Smart contracts is a great idea to change that.

James Robertson,"9:38 just to answer this one question for anybody interested: Bitcoin is still inflationary as long as more coins are being produced. This will continue every 10 mins until some point in the mid-22nd century. So technically it is incorrect to call it a deflationary asset for now. 

More generally, I think there is a case for saving your money in deflationary assets. Many countries have been victims of aggressive inflation in recent years, and this is, according to some, the result of irresponsible practices by central banks. Printing money and dumping it into the supply. 

Bitcoin offers an alternative with no central bankers, and no currency debasement. I agree that there are plenty of scams in crypto, but the one great (and unique) thing that Bitcoin has going for it is that it cannot be debased.",2023-01-04T21:33:42Z

Romar Boer,"Although I agree with a lot of your points, you seem to want to sketch the entire space in a negative light. Which is the exact same thing as an influencer trying to get you to buy an ape through hype.

I’ve been in the space since 2020. And it has changed my life for the better. As artist I was unable to make a proper living or execute my own visions. Nfts made it possible for me to create a world that is new and interesting. It allowed me to be creative in different ways. And connect to all kinds of people. Value = subjective . It’s a belief at its core. And that’s exactly what you see happening all the time. Folks invest because of hype, then get rugged. But that’s the thing, in a decentralised space you are responsible for what you do. You alone confirm the transaction. It’s an unfortunate truth there are bad actors out there, that abuse your optimism and make false claims. But the opposite is also true. Value can be created, through many different factors. The internet has value because it allows you to communicate directly to one another. At least that was its first use case. These days you can do countless things. Blockchain is one of them. Sending money in seconds to any part in the world is huge. And the fact that if you wanted to, hold complete power over that virtual cash is huge. That’s a big undecided.  Because money is power. Trusting the current financial institution is like trusting a pyromaniac to stop a fire. An institutions first and foremost purpose is to stay alive. And it can only do so by harbouring the interests that keep it in power. What happens if you want to take out 50k in cash? That’s not possible. Why is your wealth on a bank account any different then that on the blockchain? Belief. 

You might not see the value. Especially after this crazy period. But you can argue this for everything. Cryptos true value is the ability to iterate through this communal effort. It’s allowing individuals like myself to have a voice and set a different example. It’s a space that still has a lot of growing to do. And I personally think it will.

For me there are a lot of moments where I am like, why is this not on the blockchain? For example, government spending, apps from the AppStore, in-game items, community proposals , mortgages funded by a community rather than big banks, supply chain tracking, and of course art. And I reckon as the digital world takes us over more and more. Wouldn’t it be great if we had a decentralised foundation to make sure that this digital world we interact in is actually our own? 

That said, great documentary. To be honest it made me feel not so great as my entire livelihood depends on this industry. And quite literally pays my rent and bread. As artist there is not that many opportunities. The starving artist stereotype is real. And the idea of going back to that is quite honestly terrifying. So I hope nfts , web3, crypto keeps growing, innovating and finds ways to get rid of these bad actors. So that we can actually enjoy the decentralised nature and beauty of this digital landscape. 

Cheers",2023-01-04T21:06:55Z

Allison Hart,"it's really sad, because the broader idea of a decentralized currency that could bypass, for example, bank's transaction fees and processing times, in order to very quickly send money back to your family living in a 3rd world country, for example, is awesome. the idea of an entire population going around their corrupt or defunct government by having a viable global currency to use instead IS cool as hell, especially if that currency were actually stable.

obviously that is NOT crypto. but even in Satoshi Nakamoto's vision and white paper back from 2007, you can see that – as a broad concept, libertarian in the true sense and not far-right sense – it was supposed to just be a decentralized, ""free"" P2P monetary system.

Maycon Cruz,"You know, that part where it says ""NFTs are a solution in search of a problem"" isn't entirely true. If you look at it coldly, the whole concept of crypto is basically trying to convince you that there is a problem, and that problem would be called ""we don't have enough monetizable stuff to speculate on"". And that comes to light when you better understand what Web 3.0 proposes.

Broadly speaking, Web 3.0 is a concept that says the next step for the internet is to be an integral part of real life. Your everyday life is always connected, your possessions are always connected and most importantly... the economy is always connected. It would be a kind of ""Schrödinger's Virtual Reality"", where everything is both tangible and real, but also has a virtual presence. And if you recall, there is one more technology that many companies were trying to push as the next evolutionary step for society: metaverse.

Basically, all this effort is primarily aimed at overthrowing the importance we give to the tangibility of things, so that we can migrate this to a virtual environment. As the video itself exemplified, not only money could be assigned to a blockchain, but also real estate, contracts, patents, diplomas... Everything from goods to monkey JPEGs would have a blockchain, and everything could be traded and monetized. 

And this is how, my friends, a cyberpunk dystopian future begins, more specifically Ernest Cline's Ready Player One, where everything revolves around a game along the lines of a metaverse where people live, study work and consume using it as an intermediary made of blockchains...

An intermediary where men in suits would be free to monetize every aspect of our lives and control who should get rich and who should settle for being just another cog in their system, thus defining the sizes of the slices of the great pie of hyperconsumerism.",2023-01-04T16:23:17Z
BWAProject,"XRP and XLM can transfer value anywhere in the world in 3 seconds. Traditional correspondent banking takes 1-3 days. 
XRP and XLM can transfer value anywehre in the world for $0.0001. Traditional correspondent banking charges anywhere between 25-250 basis points. 
XRP and XLM remove the need for pre-funding, a requirment in traditional correspondent banking (for liquidity/collateral/trust), freeing up trillions of dollars of dormant capital. 
XRP and XLM can source liquidity using native infrastructure. 
XRP and XLM are hugely scalable at 1500 tps min, and use next to no energy. 

Go and look at the companies Ripple or Stellar, and how much headway thet are making in the cross border payment space. They are the literal definition of utility and a disrupter of incumbent technology.

Iangamebr,"This is one of the worst videos on the topic that I saw. Instead of talking about the technology, you just jumped between examples of scams and fraud like it's the absolute truth and the only thing possible to happened inside blockchain. Not only that but every minute or so you talked about something that straight up wasn't true or it is the omission in some aspect of what happened or it's just said in a very contrived way to reach a point/conclusion that you laid out for yourself beforehand. 
The internet in a great deal is used for porn and scams and it's already more than 3 decades old, does that mean internet is bad? Obviously not. At the same token crypto only being a decade old and it been directly tied to the financial system it has scams and fraud, does it make inherently bad? Obviously not. 
So crypto doesn't have any actual use? Yeah go talk to all the people in Venezuela, Sri Lanka or countries in Africa that would literally be dead by starvation if not for the crypto that they use daily for making transactions, saving lives for me is a valid use. Crypto is as scalable and as secure as it can get, much more than any other system in reality right now, that's why there's layer 2 and layer 3 solutions for scalability and thousand upon thousands of transactions per second is a thing.

An incredibly smart and predictable way to determine the authenticity of a message.

I agree to the fact that there are people using technologies to their pure greediness ends. There's a lot to say on that side of the coin. As someone who do great jobs and I respect all you've done in the past, I suggest you to make a more objective study on Crypto-currency. Don't focus on a ""failed revolution"" as you said and make it the root of all bad things that are happening in that sectors. 
The USE of that technology is the root of evil outcomes reported by many with example like the NFT, Terra and FTX scams, etc. Try to show what the real problems societies encounter at different degrees are. 
The world desperately need people who do not work with even a slight level of complaisance to the establishment. Professionals that pin point the exact hidden issues that our society suffer. Greediness will always try to manipulate all form sectors Old or New, Innovative or Not: In finance, in politics, in medicine with Big Pharma as some people calling it, hiding their real purposes behind a bunch of laws and work ethics. With claims that they work for the welfare of people while trying to shut down anyone who tries to do things in a different way and make way better solutions for people that their greedy interests start to suffer.",2023-01-04T15:16:59Z

For bitcoin to actually be a currency, it should NEVER ""go to the moon"" it should ALWAYS be stable. Who wants to go to work getting paid in a currency that could drop in value to be utterly worthless right as you cash your paycheck, and then spike up right after you buy your weekly groceries? That's absolute insanity. This shit was ALWAYS a ponzi scheme.

When you put it togheter with other coins, you're just showing yourself as someone who don't know what you're talking about. Also, selling art as NFT is totally legit, some things do have value while others not (like random monkeys). Ethereum is a centralized token, it has a company behind it, who can control or destroy the token. Bitcoin and Monero are descentralized, and they're completely detached from a central company that controls it. Also, it didn't fail, it will always survive. Also, Bitcoin is becoming adopted all over the world. It is a very slow process that can take decades.

Crypto isn't the equivalent of the internet, it's the equivalent of shares but instead of buying part of a company, you're buying the ability to action certain processes. The only reason crypto holds any value is if people are willing to pay for these processes. Some of those processes could be monetary based, some could be verification based, some could be calculation based, etc. Nearly all projects are scams, and most that aren't scams are overvalued, but they still have potential to be useful.",2023-01-04T15:01:38Z

King of FKing Everything,"32:16 I minted apes and NOBODY promised me any money. I just liked the community. I understand NFTs though and coukd instantly see the value. None of us knew of the airdrops to come and the mutants at the time. Celebs were late to the game.
Of course people wanted in but didn’t know to handle crypto. Moon Pay is an easy way for new people to buy who has no prior experience in crypto. The dinosaur banks don’t know. Though the banks use blockchain and buys tons of ethereum. They’re building on it. Yet no media talked about it because they want the prices to remain low until, they are finished buying as much as they need.
We who bought NFTs early were inundated by people who wanted to buy cryoto and NfTs. Moo lay was an easy way at the time. Since then, coinbase has a NFT platforms.

Whilst you’re at it, You should have covered how the stock market is run as well.. talk about insider trading and shorting perfectly great Americans companies (greed, grifters)…
 
I wasn’t wrong when I believed in some of the NfTs.  Celebrities joined a year later…  I still believe in HfTs as it’s a mind blowing technology that will so,be a LOT of issues we can’t in todays system. 

Btw, Why don’t you show the full tweets and other tweets?
And you put real grifter  Ryder Ripps in this documentary? It’s such a one sided coverage, so anyone reading this, please do more research.
Talk about the biggest grifter of all, fooling ignorant NEW people to buy his new NFTs. He just copied the apes and minted a new Bored Ape collection (not verified obviously, using copyrighted art). His NFts are now worth nothing, but he managed to fool many newbies.
We tried to warn the newbies constantly about that guy.  
He’s being sued by the Bored Apes for copyright breach and defamation.  Where’s that news of him ripping off new people??

Why aren’t you calling him a grifter? And a thief, stealing other artists work??? after him? 
Yet no mention of that? Hmm…
Have to say your coverage so far is very anti NFTs , that it seems that your aim is to steer as many new peo9e away from crypto and NFTs as possible.

This is internet web 3. Imagine if we weren’t allowed to participate and use internet! That’s madness to even think of today, when folks understand what it is. But they didn’t understand it 20 years ago.. Same story then. It was all a fraud, ponzi..
The governments wanted to ban it! Where would we be ? We would be third world countries.

This is the new 1990s in tech on steroids..
Where there’s money, there will always be criminals.

I can’t tell you if we all will be using the blockchain 10 years from now but pretty much all of the points and views you bring up here can be done the same way for companies and the stock market as well. 
There will always be scams, there will always be people
 who see opportunity to make a quick buck and swindle others, it has happened throughout human history and it will likely to continue, but that doesn’t automatically tell you that the systems that these schemes are built on are themselves part of the scheme and destined to fail.

So I would love to see maybe a follow up or remake in the future that tells a much much wider story and not only focuses on the scams and people who manipulate the infrastructure.",2023-01-04T11:01:49Z

Nikolay,"Brilliant work.
I'm also grateful that you didn't dismiss the earlier bitcoin community, because even though people who joined pre-2013 might have seen the most profit, we were also the least profit-oriented wave of cryptocurrency enthusiasts.
The shady individuals that took over the space in 2017 do not represent our initial ideals. Even when the space was taken over by grifters, the ICO mania still managed to provide a lot of utility, something that you seem to dismiss because of the noise that the scams generated in the meantime.
But we now have:

- The beginnings of a global computer
- Smart contracts that ABSOLUTELY can replace some traditional ones (emphasis on SOME, and the fact that this does not require a new crypto token)
- Systems designed to tell between truth and lies coming from an outside (non-crypto) source that could greatly enhance said smart contracts
- New consensus algorithms that genuinely provide a huge breakthrough for cryptocurrencies, with instant finality and low power consumption, without sacrificing decentralisation and censorship resistance
- The most downloaded app for the past 3 years in Venezuela which saved millions from poverty, while also working on a network that should reinvent money (using non-crypto assets as backing) to provide inflation resistance for the middle class
- A web browser that protects its users from a significantly darker and more malicious world of online advertising networks than the low-level crypto grifting influencer crap that you've exposed here
- A significantly more convenient to use version of the US dollar
- And a few reinventions of traditional financial institutions on top of a blockchain, that provide legitimate improvements over their centralised counterparts and which I actually use on a daily basis

And plenty more projects of actual use. I'd argue that the NFT craze was the first crypto cycle that provided nothing but scams. There have been other cycles, in which to an outsider it does appear that everything is a scam, but that absolutely wasn't the case. Value was being created, from which money was being made, which did attract influencers and grifters wanting a share of the pie, who then took over all the social media and communication channels. But hidden in the corner, the value creation process was still there, it just wasn't given attention because it didn't promise riches for no work.

Last but not least, darker times appear to lie ahead. Cryptocurrency can provide censorship resistance and protection against malicious government actors and dystopian political regimes - the very first reason for its existence. IMO it is naive to think they will not be of use in the future, even though we're all hoping that things will not turn as dark as some of the predictions. But it wasn't long ago when a journalist who dared to expose those in power had his ability to bank stripped away, only to be saved by bitcoin.",2023-01-04T09:52:31Z

Any artist can create an artwork and then make a legal contract that says that they get X% of any secondary sale. That's very true and in that one specific way the contract is similar to a smart contract...

But the reality is that only already wealthy big name artists can afford the lawyers required to chase down and enforce that contract.

Smart contracts did enable a whole new generation of artists to make a living and collect royalties in a way that was always owed to them *legally*, but smart contracts was the first time they could actually enforce those royalties in a meaningful way.

nogood,"This is the 1000th “NFTs are a bubble” / “Crypto is a scam” video in the past three years. You also got a lot of “facts” you stated wrong. 

For one, Bored Ape Yacht Club did not sell out in 12 hours. How do I know this is wrong? I have been in the BAYC community since the very beginning. A LOT of what you stated is true though. There is a lot of vultures in crypto/NFTs. Celebrities made NFTs look bad along with the scammers. 

Nonetheless, I think it is wrong the attitude people have towards NFT collectors. We don’t care what you enjoy or collect, so why make fun of others for collecting NFTs?

Sure, it's true, but scaling can be easily resolved to the degree needed in the short term quite easily. Larger blocks. Other cryptos did exactly that and there are other solutions to scaling that are even better. This is such a stupid argument against Bitcoin or crypto unless we're talking more specifically about the developers behind Bitcoin and whose controlling that development.

While some of the criticism is warranted the way this is able to be used to transfer money has been so helpful for my family. And I know it's the same with other people too who need to send money to relatives outside of expensive platforms like western union and other online transfer sites. Also some of the ways smart contracts are used to provide insurance to uninsured farmers and guarantee transactional/contract executions is extremely useful. Not to mention this has allowed for many people without access to traditional financial tools to for the first time have access to them. I think there are also ways NFTs can be used to solve problems with ticketing and scalping and identity verification. There are many use cases that are being actively pioneered so I think it's pretty unfair to say web 3/Blockchain/crypto doesn't have anything to show vs say the internet.",2023-01-04T04:21:29Z

Example BITCOIN will only ever have 21 million tokens in existence right now i believe the circulating supply is around 18 million.    USD is inflationary with the fed reserve literally printing more money as they see fit, which devalues the dollar. Inflation is at 8% meaning over a year you lose 8% of your income through inflation.

Take Walmart for example, they used blockchain to solve their supply chain issues.

And I truly hope that the crypto space will see some kind of regulation for once, as this will not only help with general perception, but attract much more than it has already attracted.

The future of web3.0, blockchains, and cryptoeconomies is exciting to me, but I completely understand skepticism as well.

veritas liberabit vos,"Block chain and smart contracts have business cases - having something like ETH which is used to pay the services that verify the blockchain record being committed or doing other work for contract execution is a good way to do things (user pays environment). This is basically what other currencies (Dollar, etc. do) - it is the legal form of exchange within a country (Allows the government to control commerce within their country and collect taxes, etc.). To imply all are MLM or other scams is incorrect. Bitcoin was developed as proof of concept for digital currency and solving the double spend / entry problem by having validators verify the records and have consensus to accept the work in the blockchain history.

NFTs - Sure I would agree they are worthless and that this is just people gambling with their money. And yes people can make a copy of the picture or the database that holds the picture could go offline - thus you have no access to what you paid for. Yet the underlying idea of property ownership and having that validated and verify by an impartial and distributed system is a great idea. It means governments cannot stop people from transacting on their property, which they can do by putting you on naughty lists with banks. There is still the issue with onboarding / off-boarding money from the blockchain through exchanges.

And yes, most of the thousands of cryptos will fail and be worthless. This has happened throughout history of new technologies coming to light and failing and just a few surviving to dominate till something else takes over by offering a better solution. That is what is happening here and there are people who have coming in with the intention of just making money (Many through NFTs and some through crypto and rug pulls and other ways) some cryptos fail due to the project being a bad idea and like a company failed in the market (You think all venture capitalist investments win, not even close, most fail. It's the few that do win they win big and deserve the big returns in taking the risk and hits for all those that fail.)

Governments and regulators need to come in and put laws in place to provide more protections. You will see in the coming decades national currencies going digital. Saves on a lot of resources being wasted (paper / plastic production and disposal, printing presses, security and transport and storage) these all have costs and digital may help to reduce these. And that is what a market economy is about, allowing the market to determine what is the best solution for now.

Notice in all this I'm not talking about making money, I'm talking about solving problems and introducing features / products we may learn to improve our lives (like iPhone did over the old Nokia flip phones). The issues with counterparty risks (who owns the wallet / crypto - like exchanges being a bank where funds are pooled to having your own wallet and you manage the risks - how can this be made more safe / secure / user friendly / protections, etc.)

Blockchain is not just used for crypto, Oracle has been looking at it for database transactions.

This is bigger than what this video is about. This video, rightly, points out the shit fuckery that a lot of people get up to when it is hard to hold them accountable and a lot of people with little knowledge can make really stupid decisions that impact them for life.",2023-01-04T01:24:12Z

mariopot789,"This is such an excellent video , having worked on an indie game during the entire wave of this crypto maniaput me into close proximity to so much of this and it's excellent to see a complete narrative tying all of it together. 

From when crypto Kitties burst on the scene t and there was a curious optimism to seeing the surge of NFT "" art"" projects where friends of mine had there art and music mercilessly stolen and repackaged by people organizations they had no clue about to me recalling having meetings with publishers who told me I needed to convert my VR game into a Metaverse NFT project along the lines of Axie Infinity if I REALLY wanted to make some money. I recall an interview where a guy mentioned halfway throug hthe project was an NFT game project because clearly the studio was getting rejected left and right by talented devs hwo wanted nothing to do with them.

However I  also had friends who abandoned traditional game studios to work on Crypto projects, I watched as other indies tied their boats to crypto because merely mentioning crypto in a pitch deck guaranteed you money, I think of situations like Ubisoft trying to do a quick NFT cash grab that I think had triple digit numbers of users  for Ghost Recon Breakpoint  , I sat on panels where people asked me questiosn with wide eyes about the value of NFT's for games which I  had to reverse and ask Do any of us REALLY want to turn our game experiences into a constant day job ? 

The craziest part  though is at every step of the way simple questions.. the MOST BASIC questions about why NFT's and Crypto pervading games and other technology spaces was a good thing was met with the MOST INTENSE denial I've ever seen without addressing any concerns .   

It wasn't just normal fanboyism people connected their lives, hopes, and dreams to something they barely understood . Truly a mania and so well documented here this took me for a ride as someone who just kept watching the NFT castle being built and second guessing myself if it truly was a nothing burger wrapped in shiny buzzwords or if somehow I was overlooking the biggest opportunity of my life and missing a key detail.

It's been fascinating to be so close and yet on the outer fringes of a bubble pervading my industry .  I feel like I could have dove into the crypto space at anytime but it never felt like anything but empty promises and hype to me definitely an example of trusting my gut because if I followed my greed or the people I knew swayed by greed i'd be in a really hard place right now.",2023-01-04T01:14:38Z

JayTrades,"All you did was call out everything in crypto that was doing crypto wrong. Bitcoin sucks as a store of value because of its scalability problems, yes! But other currencys are solving this problem. You spoke about garbage made on the ethereum network, but no about ethereum itself being used as a store of value. The idea of crypto that actually has held its own and gets stronger every cycle is decentralised store of value. Games, NFTs, most tokens, all fail at this. And bitcoin cant scale due to its proof of work. While ethereum is limited by gas fees but that can be solved eventually with work from the developers. We have rising interest rates, so ofcourse everything will go down. Thats common sense not just crypto but stocks too, an example of why decentralised store of value is. When Afghanistan took back over the country, all the banks shut and people lost thete money, and money is just a tool used to exchange for value. If they stored there exchange for value on the blockchain it would of been immune to the banks closing. Kanye west had millions of dollars frozen on him in the bank, if he had his value on the blockchain, this would not have happen. The reason crypto is so volitile is because people try and do things that dont work and fail on the blockchain, when truly it should be seen as no more as a store of value. Crypto is extremely volitile and has been the whole time because people seem to think its made for other things, and buy into scams and nfts and failed ideas and false projects, people spread fear about it and dont understand what its actually supposed to be used for. A peer to peer exchange of value or storage of value. Yes at the beggining you said bitcoin sucks as a peer to peer network because of its slow speeds and electricity consumption. That is true. But there are other alternitives that are faster, can support more transactions, and dont consume anywhere near the ampunt of electricity. These systems are known as proof of stake. Proof of stake networks are the only viable thing in crypto that actually hold a purpose and a usecase. Ethereum, and bnb are 2 examples of a proof of stake network that can be used as a store of value, all this other shit is garbage and if you invested into it and lost your money, its because you didnt do your research, ADA is also another example, xrp is another example of proof of stake. Do your research. Guarentee you the creator of this video also knows this information and is trying to FUD that bit harder to get lower entries into these proof of stake tokens. As people dont educate themselves on what they put there money into.",2023-01-04T01:09:46Z

Financial transactions going from US to Europe can take a week by traditional means.  Utilizing XRP for example could have it done in minutes.  I do not want to list everything, but there is potential in crypto.

Lorem Autsem,"Can agree with opinion about NFT, ICO and no name tokens—it’s all about scam. 
Speaking about Bitcoin, you’ve skipped an explanation of the central thought of blockchain - decentralisation. Why on earth do we need decentralisation? You’ve mentioned Visa & MasterCard and their transaction capabilities, but guess what? they can kick a country out of the system. It’s what they did with Russia. So, currently Bitcoin plays niche role where it allows you to transfer an asset despite government regulations.",2023-01-03T23:49:52Z

SanziL Madye,"When something doesn't have a intrinsic value it's a Ponzi scheme

Is Amway a Ponzi scheme, everyone believes so but it's still up are running, since at the end they still sell consumable products, may it be overpriced or through cult like marketing techniques but the product exists.

The thing with crypto is finding that value, and it all comes down to centralized vs decentralized architecture. Almost all and any technology can be implemented in both fashions, centralized is relatively cheaper and easy to maintain. So if you follow what ain't broke don't fix it approach. Web3 and all these other peer to peer use cases would never see day of light and crypto won't have any legit use case. But if trust of people in centralized things is damaged enough there would be reason to adopt decentralized architecture where crypto can play some role and thus creating a value and no longer being a Ponzi scheme. 

Will that ever happen is the question?

Blockchain is not a buzzword it is a very real software design/architecture but with a  very niche use case and even higher cost of implementation and adoption. 
Will any use case cross that barrier? I don't know.
And to run things on these Blockchain some kind of incentive will always be needed to keep the peers running. And that will be value of the coin, the real life electricity you burn to run the network.",2023-01-03T23:07:48Z
Lucian Lechance,"As soon as I heard about Crypto in 2010, it's so obvious it's a ponzi scheme and when Governments implement this as a Digital Currency in Canada, it will give Government(s) more of a strangle hold on controlling us. I.E in Canada, if you donated to the Trucker Convoy, they froze your bank accounts, imagine what they can do with a digital currency and electric vehicles, they will most definitely use it to exploit and enslave us further.

Crypto was a great opportunity to run the bull, and like a lot of smart investors like myself, you can clearly see crypto has no intrinsic value, it's based on market sentitment, I rode that bull and sold my heavy ETH position in Nov of 2021, buy price was $1100 USD and sold at $4834 USD.

copper field,"Bitcoin and some aspects of crypto is truly revolutional. what you are talking about is pure human greed that has crept into the crypto space to corrupt the pure nature of bitcoin and part of crypto. 

It's difficult to sometimes convey the feelings when you can receive money from someone at the other end of the world in a matter of seconds or minute without having to ask permission and go through all the value-extracting traditional financial instiutions. there's something magical about that. And that's why crypto is difficult to kill.

Mark Satoshi,"James, whilst you were fairly accurate with lumping the sh_tcoins together as giant Ponzi schemes, you are completely wrong when it comes to include BTC as a Ponzi.  Our current Financial System is one giant Ponzi.  BTC was initially created for the purpose of breaking the monopolistic FIAT system.  If anything BTC is starting to behave more towards its original purpose. Sound money. Non-government interference. Blockchain was the initial beginning.  Fastforward 2023.  Artificial Intelligence is the new Web3.  Come back in a few years and tell me I am wrong.  The AI war has only just begun and fat Governments who think they will control the future financial system by increasing surveilance and introducing further cleptocratic authoritarian controls will get left behind.",2023-01-03T22:37:29Z

The major one being stable coins that enable cheaper remittance back to your home country as well as offering a fast offramp for unstable economies e.g Argentina, Lebanon. They also offer better exchange rate as a de facto FX broker as seen in Nigeria and other countries. Countries with high levels of corruption and banking regulations that prevent capital flight benefit the most from stable coins.",2023-01-03T22:36:42Z

Sprinter,"Personally I believe in crypto, I really do I dont believe its a giant scam rather that its riddled with scams and people trying to take advantage of others. Personally I believe that Bitcoin has too many technical problems to ever become a global currency, rather it will become an asset that you can back other things against, like gold. If that is sustainable, I dont know. But similar points could be made against traditional investments like Gold, and Bonds. But there are real use cases coming along, crypto currencies are helping people in Africa where they dont have large financial institutions or a stable currency to get paid in. So they use bitcoin which is peer-peer so its safe. They also dont have to worry about there Bitcoin being lost. Like in centralized banks, because while Bitcoins value could collapse, Fiat currency and centralized financial institutions also have similar risks. I mean whats backing the value of the dollar. But you have cryptos like Helium which you can use the coin to buy wireless network service from. So while bitcoin does have problems and so does every crypto, I think that traditional finance has even more problems. With NFTS I do believe there core technology also could be extremely useful as well. I completely agree that PNG's of horrible art is way overpriced I believe they give NFT's a bad rap, NFT's have use cases, like what if we could make documents like, diplomas, house deeds etc. On the blockchain, it would be impossible to forge a document and it would be completely secure and couldnt be destroyed in an accident like a real house deed or diploma. Also while Bitcoin uses a lot of power it also uses only about .5 percent of the worlds power. And I get it thats a lot, but there are a lot of different ways to cut power. The crypto space has also been trying to be more energy friendly as Ethereum switched to Proof of Work recently and cut power consumption by 99.5 Percent. But overall this was a good video and I do think it is good to call out problems you see and to make people aware but at the same time I wish you would have also talked about crypto currencies benefits and the short comings of traditional finance which also suffers from similar problems as crypto currency.",2023-01-03T22:32:44Z

For example the scalability issue, is not a bug, its a feature, it can process only so many transactions, so any person in the world can have all transaction from beginning on off the shelf computer. Its easy to have more scale, but then it would not be decentralized, as people in Africa cannot afford expensive databases to store millions of transactions. Scalability of bitcoin is solved on so called Layer 2 - Lightning Network, and similar projects. This is just one answer to your criticism, which are as I said very basic.

The only problem is that if BTC is a ponzi and it can’t be broken down to satoshies then when the CBDC come along and they’re successful then we are in trouble.

I'll keep watching later, but a quick correction: Bitcoin's supply is fixed, but its issuance is disinflationary, not deflationary. Compared with fiat currency issuance which is highly inflationary (i.e. $USD purchasing power is guaranteed to drop over time because the supply increases ~10% per annum. Hence, you can't save in USD, only in USD denominated assets like housing which only increase in price over time, as the value of the currency against which it is measured decreases).",2023-01-03T21:51:08Z

The author falls in the trap of not separating the technology in question from it's false impostors.
Every new tool or technology through human history has at its early stages people who use it to make quick money or short term gains .
Yes there is ton of scam in the crypto world but that's is not the fault of the technology itself , it's because of the greed of the human condition which has always been the case .
I mean look at our current financial system, countless banks, financial institutions and government bodies have been involved in big Ponzi scheme ,money laundering and all other kinds of criminal activity and stealing people's hard earned money.
But the system still works and people still use it .
Look at the situation of the United States dollar as it has been the international reserve currency for decades  ,  the feds are just printing money out of thin air as they wish, it's just thin paper  with no real value in it and sooner or later it will crash and be just green funny papers .
so the  obvious extremely more dangerous Ponzi scheme is our current financial system, it has been running for years and years and it's causing all this huge national debts and inflation around the world and it's the one that we should dismantle, maybe crypto and nft are  a scam but the real fiasco  has already been started years a go by governments , imf , world bank , printing money feds and the world elites.
A fundamental shift is coming whether we are like it or not so we are better be ready.

Wes Ch,I dont even have to watch the video to know this guy is full of shit. Crypto is as much of a ponzi scheme as stocks or insurance. The only difference between them is crypto doesn't have government regulation yet. Yes a lot of pump and dump schemes have cost people in the crypto space. But so has stocks.

Crypto = Future... 

Of course there are going to be scams out there, but there are a lot of good projects that have real world use.  We could use one for a decentralized voting system or sell our data ourselves to advertisers instead of social network companies.  There are good ideas out there.  Please don't lump all the good with this NFT crap",2023-01-03T21:32:51Z
Simon Peck,"James, you’re a juggernaut. This video is masterfully produced, well thought out and executed. I am coming away with a few questions.

At the highest level: is it fair to blame an underlying currency (or system of currencies) for the fraudulent acts committed with it? I think every type of scam outlined here has a cousin that has been committed with the US dollar, a perfect example being the eponymous Ponzi scheme. No doubt that many currencies were created specifically with the purpose of making their creators rich, but as you point out, the core motivation for creating new currency was the desire to remove power from established financial institutions and corrupt systems of government. Aren’t the motivations for this even stronger now than they were 15 years ago?

Maybe the decentralized nature and technical complexity makes crypto a ripe platform for scammers. NFT hype is one of the most destructive threats to the viability of crypto by creating confusion around the purpose of crypto and damaging its reputation. If someone saw crypto as a threat and wanted to restore faith in fiat currencies, the implementation of NFTs that we have seen was the perfect way to do that. 

Perhaps I’m still optimistic, but I think there is power in the concept of governance and great utility in smart contracts. One promise of crypto is the ability to enable a large group of people with different perspectives to quickly come to agreement on something and execute on it, all within an arrangement that doesn’t require trust.

AdF,"So idk if i got that right but: With NFTs u dont really have a certificate that its actually yours ? He said in the Video, that theres just a link to the image when u do the transaction and not the actual image ( 33:00 ) . So does that mean if somebody has the link to the image then does a transaction with the link in it himself he basically replicated the purchase and u cant see which one is the ""real"" one and which is not. Did i get that right ??  And is this the case for every NFT out there ? cause he said ""most"".

- Stock Market - manipulated by hedge funds, full of insider trading

Filip Projcheski,"IMO, what will end up happening is the following:

You have more and more countries trying to roll out CBDCs (some smaller ones already have it). CBDCs are really similar to most of the Altcoins in existent, meaning centralized and controlled by the entities that hold the most of the supply. Some of the counties developing and even some in the EU (I believe it was Lithuania) already prefer to use Digital payments i.e. Credit Card payment, refusing to accepting cash. This brings the CBDCs idea even closer to fruition in the developed world. If I am not mistaken, Australia represented their idea of digital identity. That will not only include every information about you living in 0s and 1s, but it ties nicely with the whole CBDCs idea. Ripple is one of the first that has a platform where you can create, destroy and manage CBDCs.

You see in order to make the people accept new norm, you need an independent entities like the companies/organizations/communities behind the crypto. You let them invent, create, destroy and rebuild. You let them live, so you have a sandbox environment, that does not really affects you, but yet when they screw things up, you can hit them with regulations, bringing their value down (and with that their power) and having access to their tech and progress, so you can bring it closer to your end goal.

Now, what happens with everything that is already build on the web3. Well, some of the coins will stay as one of the first, having supply limit, might become some sort of commodities (which they already are ), maybe some of the will have some extra use cases, who knows. In terms of NFTs...I don't see anything else except of a cultural value, except the ones tied to a product (like and exchange, or some sort of software) so the NFTs you own represent a share in the product.

As a way to finish my rant, I would say that I am glad this era exists, true it is filled with scammers, but it also has strong communities of people that are interested in learning and creating new technology that might benefit us. And also, there are as much as nice stories, of people coming from nowhere that changed their lives for the better.",2023-01-03T21:05:09Z

Ian Rooney,"All i can say is of course there are going to be scams in everything if there is money to be made, you can scam people with anything, its a new technology, ever since NFTs got hyped up i knew most were ponzis being funded by incoming money and royalties with nothing to offer that would eventually dry up, it was always easy to spot them if you knew what you were doing, id say maybe 5% of the NFT projects will survive.

The big picture that youre missing is what they will be used as in the future, all of these profile picture collections were like test runs for real world applications, anyone buying an expensive jpeg has money to waste to test it out, people used it to scam people.

In the future and what will come of all of this and the underlying tech is tickets, titles, deeds, pictures, anything that could be owned digitally being an NFT that you store in a wallet on your phone rather then in a bunch of separate apps that you could lose your assets on. People wont even know that they are NFTs at that point, everyone will just have a wallet that stores certain digital items.

This whole run people got burned because its the wild west and a test phase of all of this, but all of the nonsense will fade and what will be left is the actual real world use cases.

Try to see the bigger picture, the title should also be ""most NFTs are scams"" because NFTs are just a sector of crypto.",2023-01-03T19:22:37Z

Viktor Zaman,"Yup.. Great video! That is an interesting angle for the argument. Agree with a lot of what you have said about the blockchain history development and creating buzzwords to attract more retail and money. 

One question about bitcoin fundamentals.
What is a safe haven for retail investors to store their value? 
The alternative is to keep within the traditional financial system. Banks, stocks, real estate (taking a loan for 25years) 

I still believe that bitcoin's rigid, decentralized software network will preserve its value. And as you said, it is deflationary. At the same time, all other traditional financial tools are inflationary (print as much as you govern by individuals).

Even legitimate projects like Dydx, Uniswap, Maker, they all devolve into token mania.

And to say we haven't found a use case yet for btc is fucking idiocy... look at the vol of transactions globally and how much it's scaling.",2023-01-03T17:26:23Z

Ibrahim Mujahed,"for a person who had an eye on crypto (bitcoin) since 2015, I can clearly say its heading in the centralized direction rather that the decentralized direction. playing in the decentralized game is the equivalent of monopoly or gold rush, first come first server. when its centralized which is what government look for (power), that's when it actually has a chance to grow. I know crypto currency will keep growing, but not for the good reasons. business people who understand money more will take advantage of peoples emotions to miniplate and control most of crypto currency's to grow for their benefit. a token system in a computer is the definition of centralized.
I will keep investing for the sake of me knowing it an opportunity to make some money of it. but I do understand soon, the whole blockchain will be filled with filth and greed. don't be an ignorant and naïve person investing. rule one of investing, understand what are you investing in.
Also one thing you got wrong, crypto currently is deeply rooted to be taken advantage of, specially by scammers, but its a beautiful reflection on the current world economy. crypto bros recognize that the current world economy is monopolized, but instead of fighting it (which what they claim), they make it more prominent and create smaller representations of it, lying to them selves, covered by illusion and fancy tech words.",2023-01-03T17:16:10Z

TheVoidIsShining,"I watched my husband get sucked into this via specific avenues and use all the cult terms - fud, diamond hands etc. I explained to him that those who get rich are the first who buy at the right time and sell at the right time and essentially run off with everyone else's investment, thst drives value down, and theres no way everyone gets rich. Its scammy. its inherently a scheme. He said ""you dont understand"" condescendingly over and over. 

*This almost ruined my marriage. It was an addiction. It was an obsession. He got out of all of that, thank god. But what it all did to his psychology was awful.* He acted like he was rich before he ever even made more than 500 bucks in a trade. Like a total ass. It was really bizarre and all he ever talked about literally. It drove me to a dark place. Him too, and he still doesnt see that!!! 
This basically seems like a cult to me now. Wow........ He was an ""ape"" - holding amc thinking it would explode like gamestop. I told him the powers that be would never allow that to happen again - it was a fluke and they would manipulate the market to make sure of it! 

This movement changed my husband for a time and nearly eviscerated my marriage because i saw the corruptiom of it and he drank the koolaid hoping he would be the lucky fuck who made off with everyone else's money first. He spent all his time talking, thinking, and interacting over this shit for over a year. Its sick. Our society is sick and i hate this shit. Wake up.

But that doesn't stop others from selling you 'fakes' or as a 'ponzi scheme' as clearly evidenced in this video. I don't think anyone should view crypto as anything but a speculative asset, the technology hasn't matured, and we don't know if its any better than what we have now.

D Ro,"James confused crypto currency with digital assets, of which there are many categories. 
He also confuses real tech value and innovation - a dozens of private blockchains that have replaced legacy systems - with scammy applications and ideas.  

He misses very relevant and key pieces of information:

- web 1, 2, and 3 are very real evolutions but web3 will take quite a while and not everything can or should be decentralised (see the Blockchain Dilemma), and much will be mixed eg, blockchain gaming where a game is centralised by assets are NFTs / tokens 
- there are Bitcoin scaling layers such as Lightning Network 
- BTC uses far less energy than the traditional banking sector
- yes energy is needed but it also guarantees a level of security never before seen!
- illicit use of BTC is very small (3%) and we all know the Trillions of dollars of fiat money used for illegal activity 
- if centralised exchanges have failed (and the point at which criminals get caught trying to cash their crypto!) then what does that say about centralised systems and governance??!!
- I suggest people do a simple Google search to see the dozens of companies allowing BTC transactions

I agree:
- that price volatility of BTC is a threat to adoption 
- relationships between projects and influencers is generally an absolute disgrace and I know exactly how these work
- security is a big problem but thats a symptom of innovation relying on insecure ""web2"" infrastructure as much as web3 infrastructure",2023-01-03T16:32:28Z

Moggzzz,"Some fair points, but you didn’t touch on the royalties that nft creators get for each transaction nor the benefit to an owner of selling. I am all for the fact that most nft projects are scams, the majority being useless companies or pointless trashy art. However for memberships, Nfts provide an interesting approach. On launch of a club, the creators get paid for their time, effort and costs from the initial mint. If I join then join the club at a later stage, the creator receives a small cut of the transaction - a reward. If I want to leave the club, and the club’s value is perceived to be high by outsiders who want in, I can leave and sell my entry. I get rewarded. It’s a win win for me and the creator. As long as the club is doing all the right things, and it’s members are happy or need to free up cash, what is wrong with the creators and members being rewarded? Any other club you join currently, you pay monthly in fiat and it goes straight to the creator - you will never see any of that money again even if the value of the club is increased from a financial and social standpoint",2023-01-03T16:02:09Z

Prashant Jha,"I see  he is talking about the scams and ponzi schemes and how billions were gone 

But the problem is not just the outside world but even within crypto it has become more about money and bullying others to form a team 

However, those who are in it will tell you every bull cycle this crap happens NFTs became the hype this cycle but mostly because the outside world tried to cash in on the bull cycle like any other cycle 

ICOs were the biggest craze and were called a revolution in the 2017 bull cycle with unknown crypto projects raising billions without any team just an idea and 99% of the ICO companies turned out to be a scam and even then media was like well no one gonna trust them anymore 

Like celebrity endorsement became a norm this cycle due to mainstream involvement but even in 2017 Floyd Mayweather and Kardesian were fined millions for promoting a shit token

See gullible people rich or poor will lose money in ponzi schemes irrespective of the domain crypto or traditional finance 

Next bull cycle when market gets bigger people will be back to investing in meme coin coz Elon told them and lose 90% crying crypto is ponzi 

There 2000 crypto currencies because there are millions out there ready to get rich quick 

Only if maybe regulators put a certain rules on how blockchain and tokens can be formed or distributed maybe we won't have half of this problem

Bitcoin on the other hand I do believe has a future. But it shouldn’t been seen as a get rich quick scheme, I see it more as an insurance for if fiat currency ever collapses. Just like gold etc. sounds unrealistic but I would say the probability is greater than 0%, maybe less than 10% in my lifetime. 
BTC has never changed since it began, and most likely it never will. In the technology we trust. 
Anyone thinking of putting all your money into it, good luck to you, I think that’s stupid. But say <5% of your worth as a hedge against the failure of fiat currency, I think that makes sense.

RJKM777,"A really well done video, and your right about nfts & tokens, but Your view on Bitcoin is wrong! It is already used as currency in multiple countries. Just because we have life relatively easy in the Uk there is massive real world use cases for a currency that is not controlled and inflated away by greedy governments in other parts of the world. And I’m sure most people here in England will be fed up of government policies screwing us all. Please learn about Austrian economics and do a video on why Bitcoin can literally save civilisation from future debt slavery",2023-01-03T12:26:14Z

MrTactics26,Let’s see a simple use for blockchain tech to be used for a podcast would be something like make the podcast episode itself an NFT…or clips NFTs that the ‘users’ Can Buy meanwhile the creator gets 10% royalties every the episode/clip plays.  So if let’s say YouTube has an advertiser paying then the Ytuber gets an actual share of the profits.  Attach it to a smart contract…imagine making tons of money from making a viral video or making a meme instead of ONLY YT making money.  I mean it’s not that hard.  People are extremely creative and can probably come up with a million more ways.  Just cause some idiot from a VC firm doesn’t know shit about anything other than scamming doesn’t mean that some smart kid from India or wherever can’t come up with a new way to do old outdated things.  If you were so worried about technology then you shouldn’t have a smartphone.

The difference is that people are more used and comfortable to have the government rob them as usual. This is what the bear market brings.

However the part about Bitcoin is *poorly researched* and I find it disappointing you only choose information that fits to *your narrative.*
At 14:50 you describe hope of buying something and selling it for more later as a Ponzi. By this logic buying a stock, gold, or a house and selling it for more would also have to be a Ponzi. There are no payouts from new Bitcoin owners to the previous ones as you wrongly show in the video.
Also the mainstream convinced you to believe ""blockchain"" is the revolutionary part about Bitcoin, but blockchain is simply a BS buzzword.
What is revolutionary is the combination of cryptography and mining to secure the network and the inability to print more money, which in these times of 20% inflation in some European countries I find weird you didn't even mention in this video.",2023-01-03T07:46:47Z

Anyways, that extra purchasing power either goes to you, as described, or, with our current fiat system, some billionaire's fourth yacht. The idea is to take the power away from the richest 0.1% and give it to everyone; this is what that looks like. It is better than the current system because, under the current system, we are all being robbed of our future. In my opinion, complaining about an alternative system that helps the proletariat accrue wealth (the opposite of the current fiat system) is at best unimaginably ignorant, and at worst, unspeakably evil.

Bitcoin on the other hand has a chance and the criticism presented of Bitcoin has been debunked so many times.

The very problem with fiat that Bitcoin solves is that the value is depreciating.

There is an inherent difference of what ponzis are versus pump & dump operations, where imo the latter would be the right description of many crypto projects rather than ponzis (check definitions).

The problem with real estate and gold is they kind of suck to trade with. Bitcoin solves this. It has similar properties to gold as a currency. Fixed supply, only so many can ever exist. But it can be sent anywhere in the world in 10 minutes. Without permission or need of any middle man or intermidiary dealing with the  transaction. It's going to pump up and down in the meantime as people speculate on it but it's not about getting rich.

1. ""Bitcoin is a 'Failed Revolution'""

3. Bitcoin mining is insanely wasteful of energy - again, this is plain false. Bitcoin and crypto mining incentivizes green energy usage to keep mining costs as low as possible, and in the early days the hash rate was so low you could mine thousands of coins on a laptop. His whole statement here was plain false.
4. ""Bitcoin survived despite all it's failings"" - This is plain WRONG, again. You are even contradicting yourself here, first you say ""no one is using Bitcoin EXCEPT for online criminals"". The fact of the matter is Bitcoin was WILDLY successful upon release, it just was within a niche community as you said yourself of ""tech anarchists"", I remember the types that would be talking about Bitcoin were almost like the same people you would see at Devcons and Hackathons, in the early days. And even IF this LIE was true, criminals tend to be the first adopters of MANY new technologies. Anyone who is anyone knows that early days of drug-buying in the 80's and such drug dealers were infamous for using ""Beepers"", similar to modern day cellphones.
5. ""Anybody that buys Bitcoin is only doing so because they want you to buy at a future date"", this again is PLAIN FALSE, and AGAIN ignoring the VERY HUMBLE beginnings of this ""libertarian anarchist"" project. People buy Bitcoin because it CANNOT BE HACKED, and is ON AN IMMUTABLE LEDGER, MEANING IT CAN NEVER BE HACKED, STOLEN, CONTROLLED OR CONFISCATED. This is weird to me because he just said this but he ignored it right after he talked about Bernie Madoff, trying to say Satoshi is the next Madoff?? More hyperbolic, defamatory, PROPAGANDA.
6. ""There is this desperate need to find a use case for this stuff"" - he lied, again, big surprise, I just explained the use case, and he did too, right after???
7. ""Most crypto communities are encouraged to say Good Morning & Good Night to each other"" - This is the most WILD, wtf??? I have literally NEVER ONCE came across ANYTHING like this, after being in these communities for close to 10 years now.",2023-01-03T04:50:56Z

Daniel Moksmann,"James, let me take a stab at it. There is one (relatively simple) use case for the blockchain I can think of: replacing notary public officers. Not replacing contracts, but having a public ledger not backed by any government entity... In which you can certify the validity of documents/statements referring to you or your activities. Countless countries to this day rely on official stamps, official signatures and government certifications to validate private documents. Instead of paying a government official to put a stamp on my property deed (a stamp which in many countries I have to pay quite a lot of money for) or my application for citizenship, wouldn't it be simpler and less dependent on real-world authorities if I could just show that the document has been validated in the blockchain?

My point is: if there is real utility for the blockchain, it is not to replace banks necessarily, but to replace costly, bureaucratic and inefficient notary public officers. We already have this nowadays with digital certificates, but those are provided to us by companies that validate our private keys - so it is far from a decentralized solution.",2023-01-03T04:38:01Z

While ether and bitcoin are probably about as ""stable"" as crypto might ever be, pretty much every other coin is either a subset of those two, or is a literal scam, like nfts, tokens, meme coins, etc. My friend works in crypto, and he's adament the only people legitimately making money on crypto are the people facilitating the trades. And this makes sense given that's how most of the traditional markets function, whether it's stocks, bonds, commodities, or forex. It's also part of the reason that most of the grift in these spaces, including crypto (except for the outright rugpulls and other scams), is to make money off of people wanting to make money, usually in the form of expensive training and seminars, where the grifters don't even make money off of the thing they're teaching you to get rich off of.

But there is a mistake in your concept; the problem is people use them just to make profit.

Jansenbaker,"I had no idea the term ""diamond hands"" existed. Years ago, I set my reddit avatar to hold diamonds, because I wanted it to evoke a Minecraft style, with boxy features to match.
And I never heard of many of the scams listed here. I never even heard of Cryptokitties. (Obviously heard of the bored apes, tho. Also, the Beeple thing was brought to my attention thru Corridor Crew, the VFX guys.)
Just ignored the overall buzz, except the couple of times I heard about what it was supposed to be, and what it actually amounted to.
I feel sorry for the inventor of block chain technology. Although he apparently hasn't been heard from for a while, I understand. I wouldn't want to deal with millions of people hounding me.

Yes No,"Something that most people don't see, (both enthusiasts and skeptics) is the clear middle ground. Crypto without value is a pyramid scheme, crypto with value is a tool. It is similar to the internet but not to the same scale, the internet has billions of uses and crypto currencies wont scale as much, but think how much the usefulness of the internet has grown since the beginning, crypto will be similar. Right know the main uses for crypto are for security, decentralization, and resistance to socio-economic change; but this list will expand in the future.
The real problem here is that everyone is acting like this is a get rich quick scheme, if crypto is treated like a get rich quick scheme and not the tool that it is, it will continue to be a pyramid scheme. This whole thing has already happened to websites, in the early days of the internet, it wasn't used much. As the internet grew and more people began to join, the idea to get rich became popular. Everyone began to create their own search engine (like how people create unique crypto) and buy up domains (like investing in crypto), this was a fruitless endeavor and only a few made it (Ex: Google for search engines, and Amazon for domains). Even so, those who made it became rich and were/are leading the internet for many years. The difference that separates the ones that succeeded from the ones that didn't is that the ones that succeeded were seeking to use the tool to create value, rather then get rich quick.",2023-01-03T00:54:31Z

Most people can’t yet see what makes bitcoin so valuable, and that’s perfectly ok.

Learning about it is more important than buying it.",2023-01-03T00:05:26Z

It really pisses me off that these influencers, celebrities, companies and advertising really shoving this in our faces to get people hype over these NFTs and Bitcoin BS thinking this is revolution, “the future” and I knew all along. One thing that they all had in common was yes they were paid money to promote people into buying NFTs with real money and those who aren’t rich or famous suffer with false promises.

Jason Kalweit,"Im half way through your video, and i can agree with what you say and your point are valid, however much of what you say is invalid to your argument that it crypto isnt a currency. You must understand the difference between a currency and a security and in fact, the government is trying to combat the scams involved. There is nothing wrong with crypto or code or a ledger, but because the govt hasnt gotten their act together to provide clear regulation its allowed this idea to be used with malicious intent. I agree people should not purchase crypto without the understanding of the code or a trusted auditor doing a code audit. The tokenomics are pretty important in identifying a scam. But by your own description of a ponzi scheme, the house you live in would be considered a ponzi scheme. You hear all over the world that real estate is a great investment. Well, what is it? An investment? Or a place to live? If you purchased property you likely paid more then the person who built the house or last purchased the house. You lined someone elses pocket. Does that make it a scam? But whats ironic is the property you own, someone else has control over. Thats why bitcoin was created. To truly own your own property in a liquid form. Bitcoin itself is just a description of freedom written in code. My theory on where this video is coming from since being bullish on crypto to now claiming it is a scam is that somebody lost money in ftx and is jumping on the bash crypto bandwagon. But open your eyes to everything trusted crypto projects are doing. There is also something called an oracle which can validate for legal documents btw and people can be oracles and people can be part of smart contracts. Im not an expert at crypto by any means, but believe me i try to educate myself the best i can and id love to see you do the same.

These technologies aren't meant to make anyone rich rather to help solve payment issues in areas that need them the most. I guess this proposition is what we find in stable coins. 

For example, I worked one time for a firm in Singapore and there wasn't any easy way to send my payment down to Nigeria. The only solution that guarantees that I receive my payment cheaper and on the same day was stable cryptocurrencies. 

I'm just sad that many have toyed on the ideas the original designers had and exploited people of their fortunes. But I believe that while cryptography and Blockchain technologies may have grown to have bad reputations now, in times to come, they will usher in a more positive change in everyday lives whereby they truly allow for trustless payments with bindings towards truly stable values.",2023-01-02T23:10:20Z

Except in that system, it's not transparent like it is in crypto.  THAT system was why crypto was invented.  THAT's why you think the dealings in NFT's were ""shady"", because you're stuck in the mindset of the old system, whose opaqueness continues to allow you and everyone else you drag into that sewer with you to be screwed every minute of every day, without even you seemingly realizing it.

Not it’s not.
Trade is a real thing.
People trade either a good or a service and it becomes a liability to the purchaser.

The liability is then paid for by money, because barter is not scalable.

This is double-entry accounting.

A piece of money is not supposed to be valuable in itself because that would simply result in hoarding (which is why we don’t use gold anymore).

Ideas like ‘money is worthless’ means ‘trade is worthless’.

It's important to note that while some people may try to use cryptocurrencies to scam others, this does not mean that all cryptocurrencies or digital assets are scams.

Bloodwynn,"Cryptocurrency was an obvious scam in my eyes, since it's very beginning. It was frustrating for me to see how many smart, intelligent people fell into this bullshit. Even James Jani made sometime ago video (not this one), that was pretty much neutral about cryptocurrency. Measured, neutral video adds credibility to pure evil - because this is what cryptocurrency is and always was. At least this time James recognized that cryptocurrency is just a shithole, basically. Wasting real economical resources for virtual currency, speculations resulting in bankruptcy of many people and great tool for crime (especially cybercrime). And all of that without providing any single benefit for the society. Not even one.

Fuck Satoshi Nakamoto, fuck BitCoin, fuck all cryptocurrencies and all people who participate in this... ""market"".

I wanted to believe in the tech but kept telling my friends (who were all long crypto at the tops) that I hadn't seen a good use case and was not investing.   The closest thing to a use case I found was an upwork using this tech -  but I soon found out they still used credit cards and had the same Stripe fees that any other normal marketplace would have...so in essence the same ***ing thing!     I still do believe an actual use case will happen, but it will be something that most don't talk about.  Bitcoin proved a decentralized system can work in theory.  The next step is removing the proof of work aspect of it, and doing real-world testing in more advanced things like fixed income etc.  will take years and tons of changes to get right!",2023-01-02T19:34:46Z

ZuriMania,"This documentary is a nice story, but would have been better if he explained why bitcoin is different from other cryptocurrencies. Instead, he just lumped bitcoin in the same category of the other crypto scams. Never talked about why people in some countries are adopting and using bitcoin instead of their countries devalued money due to inflation and money printing. Also, why people are using bitcoin as a bank, payment rail, unit of account, store of value and medium of exchange. This documentary just felt one sided, and added more FUD to the majority uninformed people, especially in this bear market where people aren’t seeing prices rise. Videos like this are examples of why people should always do their own outside research and due diligence on assets such as bitcoin. Most uneducated people will watch this and just think it’s a scam like other cryptocurrencies.",2023-01-02T19:31:10Z

Also bitcoin is not a currency it's a digital commodity per US SEC. It is a revolutionary asset and its layer 2 solutions such as lightning network provide 1000s of transactions per seconds for the fraction of penny. There is more misinformation related to botcoin baked into this video. Everything else about other cryptos and NFTs is correct, they are 100% scams and VC firms are part of it. Invest only in bitcoin as it does have future. It won't be currency if fiture, it is a digital gold/scarve commodity. Please do more research.",2023-01-02T19:22:24Z

Government manipulation of currencies (inflation) is ripping the world apart at an accelerated pace and a secure, decentralized digital currency like BTC might be the bridge to a better financial system...especially when no entity can start creating more of it.

The Internet in its early days had extremely limited use until companies built layers on top of it improving access to the masses--Amazon, Google, etc. Solutions such as the Lightning Network on top of Bitcoin suggest similar acceleration.",2023-01-02T19:11:00Z

One point I'll make is that many new technologies begin as a solution looking for a problem. The 40 years of cryptography leading to its first successful distributed network, Bitcoin, is quite the breakthrough. Unfortunately people iterate the tech to make ridiculous things like BAYC.

The discovery of electricity didn't immediately iterate light bulbs. The network developed in the 80s by the military didn't immediately iterate to the internet we know today.

Both of these innovations needed time to grow into its potential -- ""a solution looking for a problem, or something to improve"" at the time, as some might say. If there's one thing that history suggests, it's that you do *not* bet against technologists.",2023-01-02T18:27:12Z

I know this may sound demanding/presumptuous, so please don't take this the wrong way. But the whole ""rebranding the scam/shitty thing to try to make it take off again"" ... yup, it's happened again with ""AI"" ""art."" It's the same money-chasing, passionless people that have hopped onto this utterly soulless ""get rich quick"" bandwagon - they even use the same obnoxious, gaslighting and victim-blaming arguments! As an artist it is especially infuriating and insulting (these feel like understatements, honestly. I've gone on about it enough. I'm so tired of trying to get through to these blockheads.). They even claim bullshit like ""it's helping disabled artists"" when it's actually hurting them. 
What I'm saying is, I hope that your next/future video is about how awful and unethical and anti-humanist ""AI"" ""art"" (the name is intentionally misleading) is. I suppose you could say this is a request? ""Suggestion"" would be a better way to put it. It is truly awful. If you are interested, I could let you know of some of the things I have witnessed.

Vincent Hoffmann,"James, you have identified a lot of truth that is missed by most, in that blockchain is commonly used to exploit the ignorant because of greed.
That is 120% true, and ironic given that blockchain's ""superpower"" is its ability to deliver trust by the authentication of data.
However your take is very one sided and indicative of your own ignorance.
If you would like me to point out the errors you stated in this video and why they're incorrect, let me know.

I am hopeful that you continue to cover blockchain on your channel and bring something out to balance this unbalanced video.",2023-01-02T17:48:49Z

You can see that in the superficial statements about the benefits of web3.0 that you've collected. Or by how often you equated NFTs with blockchain.

This technology  is far from a scam, bad actors and scams are in everything new 100%. A lot of crypto is trash but so were a lot of companies that went public in the dot com boom and bust.  Look back the media itself blasted the internet as a scam, a fad that would soon be irrelevant but here we are. Penny stocks on Wall Street, majority a huge scam. I am honest I’m a little bias because i have made some money with crypto but when i see something that can solve real problems (blockchain technology) i can’t deny it. Your video even pointed out some of those problem just on your prospective of it. It may be too early to invest in this technology but look at the people who invested in Microsoft or Amazon at launch. Regulation needs to come soon to keep everyone in line and let this space grow. This is just the beginning. I know no one asked but i just thought i would share my opinion. Kick ass video man keep it up.",2023-01-02T15:06:07Z

Stetbro,"To answer your final question, the answer is never, the crypto bubble will never pop. Lets say your a wealthy celebrity worth $50 million. You invest 5% of your portfolio/net worth into crypto. You now own $2.5 million in crypto/nfts/whatever. It's in your interest to hype it because it climbs in value when you and others do. Even when the currency takes a big hit if it loses 90% of its value, you still have $250k tied up in it. What do you care if it goes to zero? Its only ever a small portion of your overall investments. And next week it will be worth $500k, or a million. Volatility shakes off the little guys that are hanging on. When you realize that you're just a remora suckling at the trash that comes off these celebrity sharks, life becomes a lot more palatable. Its easier to not live in their dystopian delusions and skip the crypto, and rather, accept that you don't need to be rich to be happy. Learn to disconnect from the FOMO and it will simplify your life. The government wont step in to fix this because it has no incentive to, nor the jurisdiction unless they want to put laws on the books about it. Here we are 13 years after the inception of bitcoin and I'm unaware of any laws in the US regarding crypto scamming.",2023-01-02T14:06:41Z

Mai Fantasia,"I do not understand this cryptocurrency.  Several questions.

If I have 10 cryptocoins, how do those cryptocoins accrue interest?  After a year, if I don't buy any additional cryptocoins and I don't sell any, do I still only have 10 cryptocoins?

At a set point in time, one credit (dollar, pound, peso, whatever currency you wish to insert) is the equivalent of one cryptocoin.  I have a company that produces widgets.  As the credits and the cryptocoins have the same value, I sell my widgets for 10 credits or 10 cryptocoins.  Tomorrow, when compared to credits, one cryptocoin is now worth 100 credits.  Do I still sell my widgets at the price of 10 credits or 10 cryptocoins?

From my very limited understanding, these cryptocoins only appear to have any value when compared against a fiat currency.  Many that are pro-cryptocurrencies continually predict the downfall of fiat currencies.  Yet, those that claim to be getting rich  can only quantify the value of their cryptocurrency against a fiat currency.  If fiat currencies have zero value, would that not also hold true for the value of cryptocurrencies?",2023-01-02T13:50:48Z

Patrick  Lewis,"Thanks for your wonderful video. I talk to everyone who is willing to listen, without being pushy, about bitcoin…so far that’s just been about a dozen people.  Friends and family.  I have been unsuccessful in convincing all of them that bitcoin is something they should invest in.  Most of the time I just get a hand in the face telling me to stop before I start at the mention of bitcoin.  The process is quite frustrating truly, the fact that bitcoin is the future appears to me to be obvious if you take a couple of hours to do the research.  Investing in bitcoin is a great way to invest your money. As a result, I have made more money than ever before trading with the faultless trading signal prescribed to me by Expert Thomas Fuller. I am extremely glad I was able to join in when I did , basically the best decision I ever made last year, never been so happy.",2023-01-02T13:24:08Z

For example smart contracts might help artists with copyrights and getting their share from aftersales.

Also in gaming industry this technology might change it forever. For example your account holds some NFT character and can be used in multiple games and your private data will be safe from selling it to other companies and your crafted or hard earned items could be sold directly on the marketplace earning you some cash.

I don't think that the technology is a scam as a whole but there are a lot of scammers who are exploiting this new born technology....

Attack the scamsters, James, not the technology. Blockchain technology - Bitcoin, in particular - is revolutionary, and it will change the world. Hell, it's changed the world already. PayPal, Visa, Starbucks, Blackrock, Fidelity Investments, and hundreds of other large corporations are embracing it. Why? Because it's scam?

Bitcoin has been the most appreciating asset in 13 years than anything in human history.  If you are going to invest in something that has a 4 year cycle you need to know when to buy.   Or simply just hold onto it cos within 4 years your asset will have risen.  Or you can keep hold of your dollars which will be inflated more and more giving you less and less spending power.

Big companies have to spend a huge amount of money each year to fight illegal market who are replicating their items and damaging their repetitions. With this tech, they no more need to spend that money.
If we haven't had a lot of useful use cases for this technology, it's because people focus too much on becoming rich overnight, instead of trying to understand the tech and putting it in use.",2023-01-02T10:04:38Z

Its obv that crypto as a concept is here to stay. However I expect the extensive evolution of implementation of an online currency. Crypto & BTC as the initial implementation of an online currency may well be superceded eventually.
Crypto will prob react to the inevitable introduction of CBDC (big brother Central Bank online currency), being the OPPOSITE thesis of crypto. Cryptos reaction will most likely pendulum swing to the opposite of big brother, meaning privacy.

Bitcoin reaches final settlement within 10 min on average, with no trust in 3rd parties. I could go on, but it’s clearly done by someone who doesn’t understand financial tech nor even Bitcoin itself…

From what I can tell it's a dolled-up MLM. I do wonder how the bubble is going to pop, the cult is so big that it's becoming near self-sufficient. It's a matter of when but that when feels like it's going to be 7 generations after us (a turn of phrase here, its how the worst curses in this part of the world work) but to quote Ursula K - 'We live in capitalism.

Rn Kn,"On a practical level crypto just works better for banking and finance, but like any market a net inflow increases value, and a net outflow decreases value. And in that sense, I would accept all of the criticisms and the praise targeted at crypto, with one caveat. That is, on a fundamental level, crypto is not different from the wider capitalist economy. Crypto is a ponzi, just like national economies and global finance. Except the economy, through the financial sector is insanely over leveraged, drowning in unpayable debt, and extracts untold sums of wealth from society by positioning itself at the focal point between savings and investment. And most importantly, it is entirely unsustainable, without constant growth it will trigger a collapse. Finance is the only industry that has not been disrupted since the advent of digitization - and this relentless campaign to delegitimize that process is not surprising. There is a lot of money and power at risk. But when the legacy financial system finally fails the crypto architecture will be unencumbered, and able to provide an effective replacement.",2023-01-02T05:13:06Z

I even created my Coinbase account in 2013 when those first became available. I was also early in the most recent bull run as I happened to start working in a fairly popular crypto exchange in 2019.

It's been made even worse since it switched to Proof of Stake because it's no longer tied to the real world in terms of needing energy to validate anything. This is aside from the computers needed to run it. It's become almost like Google data centers. Ethereum requires a lot of hardware resources just to run a node, whereas Bitcoin nodes can be run on a laptop or raspberry pi. It costs nothing to make an Eth token. It will be used over and over again to rob and rug people of their money. Bitcoin was developed by cypherpunks.. completely different philosophy, and can actually be used to take advantage of stranded energy.

K Cb,"A lot of it is smoke and mirrors, 90% of crypto, NFTs and other projects are useless and are built on hype or a cash grab or both. but acting like there’s no use case already is a bit much. Take Bitcoin for example, the fact that you can send 2 billion dollars from one btc wallet to another and pay $20 in fees while if you send $200 through western union you’re paying the same amount? Also without a third party. And sending USD through banks they take what sometimes 3-5 business days btc is sent and recieved in a few minutes to a couple of hours or less. If people don’t see the value in things like this obviously it won’t go anywhere, and crypto in general will probably die, but there’s already a use case, and crypto companies are becoming better at building technology off their own blockchain. Imagine if Fortnite created a token that gave players tokens for doing certain messages, there would be people that play the game for the money of course but It also incentivises players that are already good at the game that they can actually make money for doing something they love",2023-01-02T03:42:00Z

Implying that it has no chance of ever becoming a widely used currency is jumping the gun. You can very literally see on the Blockchain that adoption is actively increasing along with nation states legalizing it. And as far as speed, his comments are just disingenuous. Bitcoin serves as the base layer, meanwhile, layering solutions will help it scale just like our current financial system. On top of that, it’s pretty much the only truly decentralized “cryptocurrency” on the market. It’s why a lot of people don’t like it when bitcoin is grouped in with the rest of the garbage out there. And finally, it’s use case isn’t just to be a currency… it’s also a store of value.

Matthew Shiers,"_""At what point does the ticking time bomb go off?""_

Perhaps it already has. The former co-founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested on fraud charges filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission two weeks ago. My own understanding is that this guy's company bailed out and bought up a lot of failing crypto projects, taking on a lot of bad debt. Sam Bankman-Fried then misused funds from FTX customers to basically cut and run, cashing out and fleeing to the Bahamas.

But this wasn't isolated to the world of crypto. FTX was tied up with a lot of traditional finance, as a result of bringing all those smaller exchanges into a single, very precarious basket. And you know what they say about putting all of your eggs in one basket...

Maybe Bankman thought that customer faith in crypto (and by necessary extension, FTX) would be restored if it was all brought together, who knows? But clearly, faith was not restored and everyone wanted to get their money back. And without enough potential new marks to palm off FTX tokens to, there was no way to do pay out all the existing marks. And there are a LOT of existing marks!

Maybe crypto currency _did_ destabilize established traditional, centralized expressions of wealth. Just not in the way that the founder of Bitcoin initially said it would. Because we haven't seen a switch from FIATT currency to mass adoption of crypto here. Just a lot of people's hard-earned money siphoned off to a few extremely lucky individuals and very rich scoundrels using extremely convoluted methods that not enough people truly understood.",2023-01-02T03:07:28Z

Ty Gorton,"It is clear that world governments are quickly moving toward CBDCs. The name of the game is.... voluntary adoption. How do you get people to embrace a CBDC? I think crypto has a role to play. Initially, Bitcoin and crypto served one purpose: to convince people that purely digital assets have real-world value. What I see happening is this: when CBDCs are officially launched, crypto holders will be offered a VERY generous amount of CBDC in exchange for their crypto holdings. It's the cheese in the trap. Crypto holders will be handsomely rewarded for their faith in the digital currency space and governments will be rewarded with millions of instant adopters of their new, shiny CBDC.

For example you claim that people would not want to spend their bitcoin because they all believe it's value will increase over time. Therefore, if people don't want to use it to buy something, it can't be money. But that is completely ignoring how money works. I suggest you look into the Gretchen's law which explains that bad money chases out good money. Simply put, people will spent first the currency they don't want, and save the currency they do want.  If someone he gave you two $10 coins, one made of 100% gold, and the other made of scrap metal, and they kept telling you they are both worth $10. You would likely spend away the scrap metal coin and save the pure good coin. Because indeed the good coin is better money than the scrap metal coin. 

People choose to save their Bitcoin because it's better money than fiat. It holds it's value over time better than fiat which loses value over time.",2023-01-02T02:30:21Z

The main reason is, because there are good use cases for crypto right now. Like sending coins from one wallet to another is way easier, and faster, then doing an international bank transfer. Or using NFTs as digital receipts, as you said. Even for your internet example at the end - there were a lot of skeptics13 years after it's conception, that didn't understand why you couldn't just read the paper, or watch the news on the TV, or pick up a telephone to call your doctor.
This is why it's called investing - you're investing in the potential you see this technology achieving at some point.

However, I do agree that there are rampant problems at the moment with scams, shitcoins, and people wanting to get rich quick. But I do believe that the underlying tech has a lot of potential, and will become a big part of the future.",2023-01-02T02:15:37Z

Not Important Policy,"I never understood what blockchain technology was, Never bothered to research it. I did trade eth and btc from time to time on their way up to $4800 and $66k but never took it seriously. I prefer to trade stocks as they allow an opportunity to short.. That's my opinion. That being said, this was a hell of a documentary and slightly tilted my mindset on crypto from neutral and careless to slightly bearish. Very informative and very well prepared documentary. Time not wasted, I appreciate that",2023-01-02T01:26:27Z
Johnathan Henning,"Blockchain technology still seems extremely wasteful and unsafe, but even if there was a Web 3.0 using a digital currency, it seems like it would go the way of the internet protocols where only one - not thousands - became the standard - and it doesn't seem like any digital currency could be worth much more than a dollar for all that to work efficiently in any kind of new internet iteration.

The ""tokenization"" of everything just sounds like something from a dystopian sci-fi story. This is more kleptocurrency promoting some kind of future techno-kleptocracy.

On the other hand, the recent catastrophes of digital currencies seem to be rapidly reconstituting the disasters during the development of our current economic system, like the Wlidcat Banking era in the 1800's and earlier crashes like Tulipmania, the Mississippi Bubble and of course the original Ponzi pyramid scheme of the 1920's.

Kuky,"You are completely wrong in claiming that Bitcoin doesn't scale and even more so that its very creator made it that way.

Satoshi has literally said that Bitcoin can scale at greater than Visa capacity already, all the way in early days, with then existing hardware and internet network capacity, so it is an absolue lie to claim that he has said Bitcoin can't scale or that it was designed with some flaw. These are all inaccurate narratives created by BTC developers who took control over the BTC code base and changed the protocol in order to cripple the system and prevent it from scaling, that is what actually happened. BTC is not even the actual Bitcoin at all, it is a fork creaked in 2017 by BTC Core developers.

Global adoption takes time and the tech is still in it's infancy, the problem with people speculating on the value is their own fault and not by design. At the end of the day it is flawed and there is a lot of progress to be made in order to cross the chasm of global adoption.

StealthX,"I tweeted you about how Splinterlands (top blockchain game in the world) shows ALL of the best uses for blockchain, and how they are only possible with blockchain, and things like smart contracts, and the DAO. Also I sent you a comparison from Splinterlands to Axie and how SPL succeeded where Axie failed, which is basically due to the breeding feature with Axie, which SPL does not have. Lastly SPL runs on HIVE, which allows instant tx with no fees, and allows so much more opportunities for microtransactions and scaling. (Not financial or investment advice)",2023-01-01T23:18:17Z

Pale Penguin,"My issue with the crypto space, isn't the technology, it's not even the mentality. It's the promise.

There's only so long you can tell us all the usecases that can and someday will happen with crypto.

You can build a fantastic system, but if there's no use for it. Eventually you have to put up or shut up, because you need our money within your system. And no matter what you tell us your system will do. All it seems to do now is take people's money and give it to other people",2023-01-01T23:07:04Z

It’s also nothing short of scary how people can hold the idea that cryptocurrency will create a new era where the old currencies will be replaced by decentralized ones while simultaneously using cryptocurrencies for the purpose of the trade and acquisition of the so called “old currencies” without recognizing the contradictions",2023-01-01T22:59:03Z

But yeah, in the 80s, Ronald Regan deregulated banks and telecommunications so banks were able to lend out risk-free loans and televangelists were able to collect money on TV in those famous scams.

The pyramids essentially funneled from the working class and new homeowners to bankers and politicians. Exactly what we're seeing happen to the people losing out these scams in the form of FTX, and the other financial middle-man, as made necessary by Bitcoin's blocksize Achilles heel. Individuals are getting lured into this no-mans land where venture capital can dominate unquestioned. This time it seems more targeted at the middle class as it drains fortunes from people who benefited mobility-wise from the last tech bubble.",2023-01-01T22:11:20Z

Widely accepted. Portable. Fungible. Store of value. Standard of deferred payments. Test cryptocurrency against any of these criteria. It fails. Can I buy a loose ciggy at the local kiosk with bitcoin? What is the price of $45 Adidas vs $42.50 Nikes compared in bitcoin? Can you imagine paying a mortgage in bitcoin with its volatility?

You make NFT looks like they are just images, and that's not what an NFT is. God how long did you talk about NFTs and not even try to differentiate from images? Non fungible tokens are simple, they are not equal to any other token. A car title could be an NFT, and when you sell your car, you just transfer it to their wallet.

Early in 2022, Chinese New Year, i met my wifes Auntie, she was enthusiastically telling me all about her son who is in ""blockchain, crypto and nft"". Her eyes lit up as she spoke about it because he was ""on the cutting edge"". Naturally I was skeptical and warned her that there wasnt much longetivity in the space, and i advised her to try and steer him away from it. She was deeply offended by what i had to say.

Later that day her son came to meet me. I told him he should focus on more conventional programming such as app dev, website dev, etc. It was like speaking to a brick wall, he just wasnt interested, he had been sucked into the mania. Since then he has been laid off from the New York based agency he worked for (they went bankrupt) abd he is struggling to find a similar job. Ill be meeting him again for the chinese New Year, it will be quite difficult to avoid saying the words ""i told you so"".

THE SAXGOD,The cool thing about smart contracts is it eliminates the legalize that confuses non lawyer types. So when you’re coding the contract everyone or the parties involved will know exactly what is agreed upon.  Everyone will know the loopholes and everything else. You won’t have a contract thrown in front of you that’s pages and pages long trying to hide outs for the one producing said contract. That’s the point. Lawyers hate it because you’re making it easier to understand what you’re agreeing to or signing up for. Now there are some cases in court now but you’re right that they haven’t been agreed to but with the US govt passing a law in the early 2000s making a digital signature equal to a physical signature smart contracts can spin from this as well.,2023-01-01T19:56:34Z

Unfortunately, the danger is still growing and its name is Central Bank Digital Currencies.

I'm from Pakistan, and I've been doing my own research on Crypto, Blockchain, and Web 3 use, and I've been very thoroughly analysing what's going on; this is what I was thinking, but I wasn't sure until you made this video, which has answered all of my questions about crypto, blockchain, and Web 3.

The reason people get confused even after seeing that there is no actual use for all of this right now is because of the influencers, hype, and marketing that have been done for this crypto, blockchain, and Web3.

Secondly in terms of use cases pharmaceuticals companies start adopting blockchain technology for their clinical trial, Decentralised data cloud using blockchain technology to protect your data, and lots of big fintech companies starts hiring blockchain developers. 

Your documentary is very biased and outdated to crypto as whole you just debunking bad actors in crypto and not the crypto which is not surprising because crypto is not yet regulated and bad actors taking advantage of it.",2023-01-01T18:54:54Z

Crypto World,"This was a well edited video, but it's a shame you brushed over Bitcoin so quickly and associated it with NFT's as if they're the same thing (when they are completely different).

Bitcoin is already being used as a legitimate currency, especially considering the fact it's legal tender in 2 countries now. It's also the most censorship-resistant currency in the world, and is the first form of currency that cannot be confiscated (when stored in self-custody). Bitcoin also allows people to transact where the banking system isn't - such as friends & family sending money between Ukraine and Russia (since Russia has now been cut off from the SWIFT banking system).

Not to mention Rosie Rios (the US 43rd treasurer) who's name is written on the US dollar is on the Board of directors. And how about Mary Jo White (the former chair of the SEC) defending Ripple in the useless SEC vs Ripple Lawsuit started by Jay Clayton a day before he resigned from the SEC on December 23rd,2020 and now headed by Gary Gensler who coincidentally taught crypto/blockchain at MIT University. 
But sure....i agree with you about eth and the NFT's. By the way....Vitalik Buterin use to sleep on Chris Larson's couch(Ripple founder) back in the day probably stealing idea's from him and David Schwartz which by the way has a patent on blockchain technology from back in 1988.

The lack of understanding of what money is and the stages every burgeoning money goes through before it becomes a full-fledged money is at the base of all the flaws here. I suggest you do a bit of research on the history of money itself. It will do you a ton of good in my opinion. Bitcoin is not crypto. And just to let you know, Bitcoin today is one of the top five currencies in the world today, out of nearly 200 in existence. Almost everything here is wrong.  Sadly, this video will not age well.

Check out work of Andreas Papadopulos. I think that bitcoin is the best shot we have at repairing current broken financial system. Sure it is easy to critize when itš bearmarket time though. BUt deflation isn't actually a bad thing, US had it in 19. century and they experienced huge economical growth. Also you can now scale bitcoin with lightning network.

It's not perfect, and there's endless truly valueless pump and dump coins, but one must understand the fundamentals of the technology to understand why we are experiencing a surge in mining energy consumption and why this isn't a problem in the future, and why there have been mad fluctuations in price, and why actual use as a currency is low.

Dragos Stefanescu,"Maaan ... I love your content, it's so spot on. Even this video does an amazing job at calling out the specific grifting happening in crypto. I do feel super dissapointed though, mostly because of the framing of the video. I agree that crypto has had a lot of bad stuff happen (in this general frenzy that we've had because of money printing), mostly because it is unregulated still (which I hope gets a balanced solution soon). 

But it seems dishonest when you don't also research the great stuff happening in crypto - there is  a reason so many brilliant minds are still hard at work to improve this technology. I am aware that most people from the outside don't have a view on the inner workings of the Ethereum community, but I highly encourage you take a closer look. The scalability while keeping decentralization is fully under way and probably solved within the next few years. True use-cases ALREADY exist - crypto is much better at remittances than any other banking system (just use regulated stablecoins), micropayments will probably be a reality soon (once scalability kicks in), decentralized finance gives you more transparency and use-cases than the traditional financial system and the NFT tech ... well, I truly believe in NFT infrastructure, but it will need more time to be properly built and incorporated (in games for example). 

Most of all this marks the current sentiment and hate towards crypto (which probably means the bottom is super close or already here). It will take a few years, but it's likely this video does not age well (in terms of bundling the technology with the grifting - I totally agree the grifting in this space is appaling and needs to be fixed).",2023-01-01T18:00:04Z

Social media validation and attention can also lead to the disease of addiction, and the main difference between the much of the past and our modern first world is our increased unmoderated access to instant gratification and our greater sense of self-importance only rivaled by Caligula. We are also dismissing as ""toxic"" many of the external stressors that spark evolutionary development and the high pressures that turn you into a diamond.

But allow me to criticize you a bit. 
As far as I know, Bitcoin is one of the official currencies in Central African Republic and El Salvador. Madeira also considers making Bitcoin its official currency. And the transaction speed for Bitcoin, thanks to Lightening network, is now much faster than any of the payment systems you mentioned (Visa, Paypal, etc.) Also the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining seems to be bloated out of proportions.
I don't have any Bitcoin myself, I'm just learning about it. And maybe I am mistaken. I may very well not see something that you see so clearly. But I think you didn't do justice to Bitcoin.
As for NFT's and all other cryptocurrencies, I'm pretty much on the same page. The financial incentives are doing their dirty job to people's minds.

I am sceptical about crypto - akin to gambling in my mind. This has made me aware that things are worse than I had imagined. It's just a series of pump and dump schemes.
From 36mins on I thought you were describing a cult. Then my heat sank when you got to SLP - that's a nightmare. Talk about taking advantage of the vulnerable and those in need.

Maybe do a video on something you know about next time?
Such as the irrelevance of the education system, how vehicles and transport need to be rebuilt from the ground up due to descendant designs being modelled after a horse and cart.
The perpetuality of solutions to problems that create industry in turn creates the problem. 
How banking system that everyone uses now is the biggest scam of all.

It was never designed to help people get rich, it was designed to put the control of money in the hands of the people instead of the hands of governments and corporations, which it still does despite the losses you’ve incurred from your greed.

The problem isn’t Bitcoin, the problem is you greedily thought you were going to get rich quick, which we all know is never a safe assumption.

Like without regulation and how discourse was online and in the real world from some of my experiences, I had to stay skeptical and look into all sides of the story to not get scammed or waste time where someone may take advantage.

Anything that’s a get rich quick thing usually ain’t it. Usually being smart with time and where your efforts go towards is where it’s at. Easy money is enticing but for a scam this wide scale to be mainstream, we gotta be wary and scrutinize and call out everything.",2023-01-01T17:10:32Z

Alen Pasnikov,"Yeah it is a Ponzi, but at least decentralized which means nobody can shut it down. Long term if you invested 1-2k$ in the right coins, then you could make a lot of cash, but if not then it is also fine. But if you don't have 1-2k$ I would recommend better to invest in yourself.  There are literally coins who will 100x in the bull run, if we see an other bull run. I don't know about you, but 100k is a lot of money where I live. I could live for 4-5 years with that money. NFTs are risky, but also some have higher multipliers. It is all about multipliers. I did about 40x on my investment doing IDOs. IDOs bring gains only in bull run, so I wouldn't advice anyone investing in them right now.",2023-01-01T17:08:34Z

But smart contact platforms have the potential to build a more open and better financial system than today. I would recommend to read the EASY MONEY 1, 2 and 3 by Vivek Kaul (who is a big critic of cryptocurrency) to understand about the fraudulent mechanism of the modern financial system.
I believe that with smart contact platforms we can create a more open, liquid, uniform financial system than the current one we have which is highly opaque and is only accessible to limited people. Best of luck James for your future videos 👍🏻",2023-01-01T16:32:38Z

Pepe Nakamoto,"I invest in cryptocurrencies because I believe that with the current fiat monetary system, it is inevitable that deflationary assets will appreciate in value and speculation will have peaks caused by monetary expansion. Crypto is a volatile place to take advantage of these movements caused by the current economic system (which I also see as a scam). Crypto is a new leg of the financial market. With less friction, much more risky, and much more potentially lucrative.",2023-01-01T16:25:42Z

Sahaara,NFTs are the greatest scam for the modern quick fix society. Dopamin by the milly second. Attention likewise. This is where we peak and it's very disappointing and sad. Sheeps do sheep things. Thankfully I'm not in the US where money is just a number and spend easily especially if it's not your own worked for. This keeps me away from scams like this. Something never felt right to me with crypto. Something felt off about it.,2023-01-01T16:25:13Z

Thomas Walma,"This video is definitely cherry-picking the negative aspects of crypto, for example, the low amount of transactions per second of bitcoin, without mentioning the improved transactions per second of other cryptos.  And it spends like 40 minutes talking about NFTs, and only like 5 or 10 minutes talking about people trying to put useful stuff on the blockchain, mostly just by showing a handful of cherry-picked, unquestioned quotes where a guy says something like ""if you think x should be on the blockchain, you don't understand x"". I agree with your assertion that crypto came first and then people are later trying to come up with use cases to justify it. But I don't think that means it's a scam. You could say the same thing about the Internet or the Apple Watch or any technical ""platform"".  The video also says that ""if crypto is so useful, why haven't useful crypto applications been implemented yet"". My response is that it's much easier on a technical level to put a link to an image on the blockchain than to engineer a working micropayment system or supply chain tracking system on the blockchain. So it makes sense that these simplistic, scammy/fad things like NFT images would be invented first. I don't know if crypto will ever be useful. But this video didn't convince me that it won't",2023-01-01T16:22:54Z

Bitcoin is not trying to replace VISA cards for buying a coffee, and sticking to that story today is just silly. Bitcoin is a truly decentralized investment and it's not hard to see why many people find it attractive as a long-term alternative to gold, land or real estate.

In regards to the energy consumption, you can't make any judgment on however it's wasteful or not. No one can and that's a good thing. Taking such a stance would lead to cancelling 49 % out of all energy-focused activities because the majority didn't approve of said activities. It's not just Bitcoin that uses a lot of energy. Better to focus on making more of it.",2023-01-01T16:14:19Z

Nick Louw,"I really don't see anything new or informative here - NFT promo schemes are nothing new, other than the name, art has always been a questionable and dark industry not used for what one would typically think. 

With all due respect, as I do value your content and professionalism, this is a very one sided video highlighting none of the positive impacts this space is having. The video's main highlight are the flaws in humans, our greed and how certain people are happy to take advantage of others via whatever channels that are available to them. Nothing new - this has been happening since the dawn of time.

Historic money cycles, developments, ''revolutions'' and mania periods echo with what's happening (and has been happening) in Crypto. 

Who knows were it will go, but if you fell into the NFT trap,  a ""VC's or Influencers new coin"", phony ICO's, or FTX type exchanges,  and are looking to get into crypto as a get rich scheme, you're very likely to fall into any other scam out there - for one reason greed. 

Its a fact, people are going to use crypto, blockchain for bad purposes - the same way people have used and still use other avenues for fraudulent purposes - like the internet, the telephone and even the postal services. 

All the people commenting in the thread here, if you did not know this before or only learnt something for the first time here - stay away from the crypto space unless you are willing to do a lot of your own research.  There are bad actors, who will take advantage, very similar to the rest of the world outside of crypto/blockchain.

BTC having a limited supply and being deflationary is a fact, but its one piece in a much bigger picture than you have covered - was it supposed to be a revolution? who knows or even cares but its very uninformed to compare it in anyway to a Ponzi scheme or Bernie Madoff, which is sensationalism in my view.

Other blockchain projects (which have great promise) aren't also trying to impress anyone with how quickly they can get the project out or to ""prove"" something until the proof of concept is ready and generally these technologies require the buy in of a lot of stakeholders and there is a massive education process which needs to happen, and will delay things.

VC's/Gov's coming in with projects via this channel with nefarious motives are at least doing it in a space where it is slightly more transparent to the public. Remember before, the rich/entitled were still doing this but there was literally no transparency. 

Smart contracts not being able to be enforced by a judge because of the myriad of subjective circumstances is very valid. But remember that system is also filled with biases, stereotypes which have caused massive, irreparable damage to society. I don't think the idea behind smart contracts was to jump into these complex issues anyway .

The biggest issue we face in the world today I believe is trust/reliability of source etc. which maybe a simple decentralized ""spreadsheet"" as you mentioned could help resolve this issue. 

Don't believe any hype, don't invest money in a new unregulated space you can't afford to loose (as you most likely will), do your own research and/or leave it and move on with life.

Me h,"Crypto, influencers (All of them, but notable; Dan Bilzerian, Andrew Tate, Jordan Petersen etc), NFT's... They are all  confidence tricks, accelerated by the instant communication that the internet  allows. What they all show us beyond any doubt is, there are a lot of gullible ""marks"" out there, begging to be conned, and that confidence tricks evolve rapidly. _So, if you've been conned by any of this nonsense, the best thing to do is keep quiet about it because having a loud whine online will put you in the sights of the next con artist and your cycle will repeat until you have nothing left to take._",2023-01-01T15:41:50Z
