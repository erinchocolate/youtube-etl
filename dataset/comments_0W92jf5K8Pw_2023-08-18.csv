Janelle,Its interesting when you become the interviewer instead of interviewed when you go for a job interview. Just keep contacting them till that manager is actually brave enough to say nevermind. It just means you're over qualified to work for them.,2023-04-26T15:25:21Z

Lala,"I think my problem is that I think too much of what the interviewer might want to hear, but that tends to lead me into faking being an ambitious workaholic who is willing to drink the Kool Aid, which is the complete opposite of who I am as a person. I think it's really helpful to think of job interviews as offering information about myself and my skills, and letting people take it or leave it. I've had a really bad time applying to jobs in the past, and I want to try approaching it in a new way now. Thanks Dr. K 👍",2022-07-21T05:08:01Z
Temporary Channel Name,"I interview for jobs a lot, and I'm very good at talking to new groups of people.  I usually have great ideas or even know inside stuff within their industry.  Like when I explain my management style, they seem to love it.

But then, they don't hire me.

I always get this feeling that they're just smiling, nodding and responding positively because they're just being polite.  They can end the interview whenever they want if they hate me, so why can't I get a job?!  I have years of experience in doing exactly the thing they are doing and want me to do.

Francis Chic,Every time I get rejected after a job interview I feel like I'm completely useless or have no value to the company I'm applying for. I know this undercut's basically everything you said but to me it seems like it would go a long way for the interviewer to acknowledge that they think someone else would be better for the position but give you some pointers for your next interview because if you don't have value for them maybe you will be beneficial for someone else. Otherwise the feeling I get from interviews is that it's their own benefit and none for the interviewee. Maybe there's a reason bigger than the job that I'm actually trying to apply for it and a lot of interviewers don't acknowledge that or make an effort to.,2022-06-02T15:50:57Z

Ritesh,"One interview advice that I got is ""Don't just mention what skills and experiences you have, but also how you can apply these skills to the job position"".

Lane R.,"He's so right. The ""me, me, me"" culture in the US has become so detrimental to the psyche of young folks (and plenty of older folks but they have has a chance at life experience changing their mentality). Walk into a job interview with the goal of offering your skills to THEM for THEIR benefit. Walk into a speech with the intent to offer your information to THOSE people. This is a massive view shift that we are never taught and have to learn on our own in the US. Maybe other countries are more prone to the service angle, but here it's a me, myself, and I culture first, and what can THEY do for ME. It makes me sad because we've lost so much good community among neighbors, coworkers, and peers over the past 4-5 decades.",2022-04-09T07:09:14Z

phesterful,"A lot of this was very helpful, thanks for sharing. I'm looking for a job right now, and will likely put some of this into practice in the next few days. As a programmer, I'm fully aware that using a skill is even more essential to learning it than merely reading / hearing about it.

I'm also neurodivergent (adhd + autism), and that often presents as clear adhd + some social anxiety (often straight-up social phobia). I have experience public speaking on college and high school debate teams (national circuits), and from work... including seriously bombing some speeches. Both from social anxiety and from not being able to communicate technical skills due to lacking them... to simply not communicating well. Among peers who've given speeches, I can laugh, because I know social anxiety and performance anxiety (stage fright) is extremely common among very gifted speakers and performers.

My perception of my own anxiety is often (not always) that I'm focused on others and do not understand their perspective. I may have trouble recognizing their understanding or their nonverbal feedback (see above: neurodivergent). I often have little perception of my own anxiety until after others react to my symptoms that they find disturbing or very distracting. That happens most frequently when I have lingering doubts about my technical expertise (real or imagined), the stakes for a conversation are high (as in senior management, regardless of expertise), or I'm including opinions that people I respect might quickly disagree with. When that type of situation hits, I am not at all focused on myself. I am strongly dissociated, from my perspective. That fits well in-line with problems I have recognizing depression until I have clear physical symptoms.

Any new ideas about that?

I should add that I often find your videos helpful if I make myself sit through at least the first few minutes. I've often said ""oh that's not at all my perspective and Dr. K doesn't relate to how I think"", while many of your later descriptions about how social interactions work are still extremely useful (again, see above about being autistic and frequently socially blind). Thanks for making the world a better place and spreading compassion.",2022-04-06T17:45:57Z
Dreami Sover,"I like the format of showing bits of the video at the start to let the people know what they are in for. 
A lot of people think very self centered, but since we are mostly like that, occupied with our own lives and thoughts, it is highly likely that our worries for how others, especially strangers, perceive ourselves are highly exaggerated or far less imporant than we believe. In an application process, I think that the company will only focus about getting a candidate with appropriate skill and perhaps company culture fit. If you are a bit awkward during the interview process or have a weak performance, but are otherwise trying to act professionally, nothing bad will happen, you just won't get the job and that's it. But always try to go for it if it is a job you can imagine working for/job you wanna do.",2022-04-06T15:19:36Z
Berrymouse,"I used to do hiring for my former company, and was part of the interview process of hiring new software developers for entry level positions. At least for me, I was mainly just looking at whether we would like working with them and secondly getting a feel for how they deal with problems. To be honest, most people who we were interested in enough to interview had great resumes and we were already 90% confident that we would like to have them. But we typically get a roster of 3ish interviewees per position, and we have to make tough choices. (Interviewees reject our offer sometimes too!) So definitely don't be disappointed if you don't get an offer.

If you get a lot of interviews, but no offers, I would evaluate the way you do your interviews. I would bet there's something obvious that is disqualifying you from offers. We had one guy who came in and was really funny and talented, but he went on a story about how he got fired from a previous job for going to work drunk. Don't tell that story at a job interview! O.o

Since we hired engineers, we would usually have a technical interview portion where we would have our interviewees solve a few problems. Occasionally, we would have people who would just freeze up and say ""I don't know"" to all the technical questions. Unfortunately, that usually let other interviewees get hired over them. But it's definitely okay if you don't know how to do things or even if you solve it wrong. We're more interested in seeing whether you were able to identify an approach to solve the problem and we definitely didn't mind helping you if you ask us questions. Literally none of our hires answered every technical problem perfectly. I didn't either, when I got hired.",2022-04-06T12:59:10Z

2. At the end of every interview mist people ask if you have any questions, there should always be one as the interviewee ask ""was there any questions you'd like to ask me so i can clarify?"" 🤷🏾‍♂️ if you did say something confusing or distressing to the employer it's your opportunity to do damage control or explain in depth.",2022-04-06T09:51:10Z

Romas Noreika,"People are miss understanding the meaning of a job interview. You have to know one thing that is it. You are here to make them money. It is business after all no personal crap. So when you go to a job interview you are actually making a trade, you are offering your time and expertise for their money. You have to know what are u selling. If you do not know what are u selling you will have a hard time in a job interview thus you will not feel the confident anout urself.

Noerfi,"Well one problem is: you want a job so you don’t land on the street. And if you have to do many many interviews or don’t even get invited to many interviews, then any interview you DO get has really high stakes. Because it feels like your livelihood depends on the success. That’s not nothing. It’s actually a good reason to be anxious. So what Dr. K describes shouldn’t take away your anxiety, it’s okay to be anxious. But its simply a better strategy to be less occupied with yourself and instead focus on the thing itself (the company, the problem to solve, your interview partner etc), so your chance for a positive outcome is just higher. It’s quite pragmatic",2022-04-06T05:43:45Z
Noerfi,"When you’re socially anxious, focus on the THING ITSELF instead of on yourself.

Ask about work culture. Ask about benefits. Ask about retention. And whether people who leave the company come back.

Harry Poderskis,"My approach to job interviews designates the interviewer as a client. I guess it is my comfort zone after pitching in a startup marketing agency environment for several years. A year ago I joined a company as an employee and dealt with toxic office politics using this setup. Toxic colleagues? They’re the clients employees, treat them professionally and deny them the right to close distance which would give them the opportunity to express their toxicity. Required to work overtime? Okay, note the hours down, seal it on with a formal email and, when I need it, inform about my leave to make up for those hours. Since I freelance, I have no job security tab hanging over my head, or as far ad they are aware, so it worked really well and every encounter with the toxic leadership turned out in my favour.

Dr. K says that one should let go of ego, but I guess I come from different worlds and negotiation IS ALL ABOUT you. And them. It may be a trick you may pull on yourself to make you more comfortable at an interview, but one too many of these tricks and you’re in a bad mindset to negotiate for your own good.",2022-04-06T02:23:21Z

don't think about the way you're presenting yourself and how you're being judged

they want to hear what you have to say
this is an opportunity to share enrich the lives of those around you

Don’t be ashamed about it, we’re asking because we want to know!

Neil Du Toit,"Former national debate champion. Great video. Dr K is on point. You almost certainly know something your audience doesn't, be excited that you get to tell them about it! 
My biggest tip for any speech/interview is also, understand your audience. Figure out what they're expecting you to talk about. That might mean going through their social media, talking with them beforehand, or figuring it out on the fly by watching how they're reacting to what you're saying. But, as Dr K says, if you get stuck in your own head, that's when you lose the audience. You have to understand them, and what they need. You have to empathise.
I'll never forget, at my first job, we were developing a small educational game for young kids. The client comes in and my boss was trying to explain to him how the game works. And the client keeps saying to him that he only knows about FIFA because that's what his children play. I'm standing there thinking, this guy is making it so easy, he's literally told us exactly how to explain things to him. All you have to do is explain everything in terms of FIFA. Use FIFIA analogies. Talk about features in FIFA that our game has as well. etc. But my boss couldn't. He just kept going on with the points he had prepared beforehand. And the client is sitting there and has no idea what he's talking about. It was excruciating to watch. This happens all the time. People tell you exactly how they understand the world. They tell you the language that they understand. Use that information! Explain things to them in their own terms! Literally even just using the same words that someone else uses will make them like you immediately.",2022-04-05T20:06:36Z

Jens A,"Something I was told by someone working in HR once, was that in many cases, job interviews are about personality first and qualifications second. If you're invited to an interview, they already know your CV, so the purpose of an interview is moreso to find out whether you're a good fit for the company. So if your natural attitude and instincts is to crack a joke every now and then, do it. If it's more to gush about the interests related to the job, do that. You don't need to prove yourself to them.",2022-04-05T19:03:34Z

Mr_Mystery,I would sum up what you said as “be yourself and see what happens”. I think people’s lack of self esteem is giving them the idea they have to mold themselves into something they are not in order to get what they want.

Mintee,"For giving a speech and thinking one may mess up, I think one idea is that this seems to be a form of binary thinking, either one messed up or one didn't, when it's really more of a spectrum of skill.

That doesn't even talk about more fundamental questions, such as is it a good business strategy to only hire people who are successful who fear failure, rather that desire success and noting that growth means going into places that one isn't as skilled as and failure is much more typical.

Then, the issue with failure I see is really avoiding costly failures.",2022-04-05T17:23:51Z

Nicholas Bonasoro,"As a person who has hired around 75 people mostly entry level positions, just arrive on time well dressed, and behave in a way that shows you have a positive attitude and a good work ethic. We called you back because we are interested in you, the interview is really yours to screw up. If the interviewer asks why you want to work at the company answer by saying I can provide XYZ skills that I believe will make me a value member of your team. Have a couple of questions such as what are the characteristics of successful people in this position, and end by asking what the next steps are. I'm amazed at just how low the bar has to be for employees because people have bad attitudes, don't show up on time, and can't be trained because they can't admit their wrong. The advice here also applies to dating. Just discuss honestly what's on your mind and the outcome doesn't matter. It's really important to have faith that there are opportunities for you and you will succeed, it may take alot of attempts and time but it will eventually turn out well for you. There are very few make or break moments I  life, you can always recover from mistakes.",2022-04-05T16:57:07Z

Luke Orlowski,My experience with job interviews is it usually comes across like they are doing you a favor by giving you the time of day for an interview. They always have so many candidates etc that it just feels like I'm lucky to even be there so I don't really agree with his premise where they are looking for you. The nerves are from oh shit if I fuck even the tiniest thing up one of the other 50 candidates probably won't,2022-04-05T16:51:41Z
Keerthana Gurushankar,"There's a pretty big difference in stakes in that young people are desperate to find jobs to pay their bills.

Elusive Man,"For me, being nervous in an interview is less about public speaking fear and more akin to test anxiety. This seems like it was advice more for overcoming nerves for public speaking, like making a pitch to your boss or speech for your class, rather than interviews (which are much closer to a test IMO). I usually find your videos very enlightening, but you might be ever so slightly off the mark here. Either way, I appreciate your work Dr.K! Cheers!",2022-04-05T16:18:02Z

Skoggomann,"This is so true. Take yourself out of the equation. Don't mistake being nervous for anxiety. Being nervous makes you alert, helping you perform your best. 

Also recognize the difference between being prepared and being knowledgable. You HAVE to be prepared to give a speech or presentation, but being knowledgable is what will make it good. Having the actual knowledge to back it up will give YOU confidence, and you will not be bound 100% by your script or slides. Then you can focus on TELLING THE AUDIENCE SOME COOL STUFF.

Also we don't have to pretend all presentations actually have value, especially in school. Sometimes they are just throwaway assignments. You can't be knowledgable about everything, but a prepared presentation is still good. Don't focus on the details. Give the MOST barebone information you can, and imagine you're giving it to a child. Just go up there and explain the simple thing and enjoy being nervous. There are people who CHASE fear like maniacs, so it's not entirely wrong to get enjoy some nervosity.",2022-04-05T16:12:12Z
