One day, a friend insisted that I accepted his invitation to attend a conference organized by a multinational MLM.  One of their products sold was various essential vitamins.  That MLM touted that their products and pricing are to help people to have healthier and better quality life.

Xavier Aou,"English is my 3rd language, so please bare with me. I've always dreamed of breaking poverty especially that my great grandfather is my role model. He  had worked his life off and got wealthy from years of farming and trading goods. He started with nothing and he found a good partner and they both succeeded and they built wealth. My father alone got 7.3 million dollars and so his siblings, but they didn't know how to handle the money that they inherreted and in less than 10 years, they lost almost everything and some of them are still in debts. I remeber how spoiled I was and how many trips and toys and fun I had when I was a little kid. Never liked it tho. My father wouldn't let me clean my room or move my chair or clean my dish ... my mother was really upset with the lack of responsibility he had and he tried to teach us too. From a young age I knew my father would end up btoke and I was right. Now I'm 27 years old with a masters degree, me and my brother, we help our parents fanincially. I got fired from my first job 3 months AGO and living off my savings now and don't really know what to do, all I know is that I'm hating to go back to the 9 to 5 jobs .. and hating the greed that people have including my previous boss. I don't blame him because this is the world we live in today. Sometimes I feel really stupid and sorry for my naive self that I still think that  people can get rich quick and without being known and share their identities, faces, lives to gain customers and audience (which I hate), without putting masks and fake smiles, without sacrificing family time, without the greed, without selfishness .. I might be wrong !

My only regret now is not learning skills, even my father kept pushing me away from any hard work and mother advising me to focus on my studies (never will get rich and reach mu goals listening to both of them) so I didn't learn any skill and I didn't try any hatd work, just kept studying and waiting for the right time (after I finish my studies that I have no passion about) to start those methodes of getring tich quick because all I want is to have money and travel and have fun again and most importantly, give that luxioury back to my poor family. 

To sum up, I really want to be rich to travel and secure my future (as a single and a child free guy by choice) and help others, but I'm scared to become a monster in the proccess ! 

I see people in hoolywood do anything for money and fame, they are hungry for power, leading and controlling others. I see billionaires with youtube channels and still working in their 90s .. I see billionaires with low stabdards .. This  really scares me, I don't want to be like that. So maybe I will never get rich in this day and age. Family always compaires me with my grandfather, so if I were born in his time, I would get rich like him too. Now, I am loosing interrest day after day because our world has become too ridiculous, greedy and superficial",2023-04-27T09:35:08Z

people sell information for money. financial education, motivational, or even formal education like school can considered as a scam if it's not give you equal return of investment.

take andrew tate, he create course $50 for a month, but all it's teach is basic thing like dropship or affiliate, then people make more than the $50 and see this as worth it, but how many that make more than $50?. are they need this course all the time? when all information cheaper and some free?

Added to this he is a nasty piece of work who is cruel and dismissive of people's emotions, aspirations and genuine and earnest desire to learn, and plain vulgar in so many ways.

If you want a real social change a Revolution is needed, but remember there is no peaceful revolution.

The rich do not care about you and don‚Äôt want you to be rich as well, they just manipulate you. Sadly we have the weakest and most coward generation of young people in history. They think they will become rich investing in crypto frauds or being ridiculous on Tiktok, 99% of people will fail doing that.

jnbfrancisco,I had a neighbor in the early 80s that tried to get me involved in a get rich quick scheme he was involved in.   The scheme was selling very expensive fire detection devices to poor low intelligent people.  His main sales point was that you weren't doing the right thing for your children if you didn't spend about 800 dollars for his devices.  His devices were supposed to be much better than the much lower cost devices because they were made of metal.  I thought they were not nearly as good as the lower cost ones.   The same pyramid scheme was also part of the scheme.,2023-03-29T17:02:19Z

I run a small business started by my dad (Proud Nepo Baby) While life isn‚Äôt always sunshine and rainbows we are able to provide for ourselves and most importantly offer a wonderful product and service to our customers. Even though I may never make anywhere close to what these individuals make in a thousand lifetimes, there is a level of self respect in knowing I make my customers lives better with the product we sell. For anyone reading this seeking to strike it rich, I‚Äôd wager to try and find something you enjoy and build something around that. Even if it fails you‚Äôre going to enjoy the process and the people you meet. But on the other hand if it does reach a level where it can sustain yourself and the ones you love you can consider yourself extremely successful. I understand what I say is obvious and trodden, but so many things in life try to belittle the life that you have while dangling something better in front of you.

Denise Boertje,"All the gurus selling whatever they‚Äôre selling to the public, it is not, I repeat NOT how to get honest wealth. They are only selling BOOKS, TAPES, VIDEOS, CLASSES. One is NEVER enough. One tape, one book, one class. 

I got roped into attending a ‚Äòseminar‚Äô on getting rich by flipping real estate with no money of my own! Never mind I had under $400 in my account, my credit was in shambles from my recent divorce. The hard sell was incredibly uncomfortable and high high pressure! I finally told the two jerks who were pressuring me I would sign up if there was a money-back guarantee. End of session. Every time they contacted me, id repeat the money-back guarantee request. They finally let me be. 

Wanna get rich super quick? Sell illegal drugs. Serious wealth is built with smart, hard work, despite ups and downs in the market, or inherited. Or by doing something criminal. Oh yeah! I forgot bank robbery, extortion, and blackmail for immediate wealth. Silly me. 

I had a client who, with his partner and their wives, was the largest holder of a popular fast food franchise west of the Mississippi. He‚Äôd opened every restaurant himself with his partner. It took them 9 years before they saw $1 million in profit. But every restaurant was profitable, but they took the profit to continue to live modestly and invest in new restaurant openings. When I met them (28 years after they started), they‚Äôd become multimillionaires, lived in serious mansions, drove Rolls Royces, BUT they‚Äôd also drop everything to go help out one of their stores. I saw them both go in their custom tailored suits to a store that had a mass shortage of bodies (due to everyone getting food poisoning) and pull a 10 hr shift from lunch through dinner plus side prep. I saw them open a franchise in the most crime ridden neighborhood and work there for months, and saw the party they threw for those employees when they hit a million in sales 3 months after opening which was 18 months before target date. Bottom line, hands on, willingness to do any menial task to make the business work, super support for their stores, and profit-sharing with ownership buy-ins.

Probably wasted 3-4 thousand all told on crap like that. But it was money well spent. Your buying your scam education. And when you graduate from that you don't have to pay that tax again. So every one of those since about 92 had no chance to get their hooks in me. In fact I have saved many people by recognizing what they were getting into and stopping them. It helped with avoiding pyramidal marking scams like drinks and insurance. When your eyes are open you see right through it. Iv never lost a cent with crypto or any other of the digital crap.

Phil,"The law of attraction is a very real law. But its misinterpreted and misunderstood especially by the grifters who use it to manipulate people into feeling like they need to buy into their program. The law of attractions real purpose is to improve our soul condition by bringing us events that expose our lack of love. The irony is there is a lot of truth that people live in poverty due to their own actions, and law of attraction. But the law is trying to expose issues that they have in many areas... usually in areas like self-responsibility, fear of lack of money, fear of insecurity etc etc. This is also what the MLM guys prey on. And even being drawn to an MLM scheme is one of your own laws of attraction - to help you learn about these fears and issues you have. Its great that you make these videos Jani as a way to share what you've learned.

I have a natural inclination to doubt something too good to be true even at my earliest years approaching adulthood. That was 1996 when me and my college close friends encountered MLM that promised us salvation for all our worldly problems. The thing is, I hated myself back then for not being sold like all of my friends did. I told myself that it's maybe because I don't have any ambitions in life. Ultimately though, I plunged in (mainly to fit in the group). I was introduced to law of attraction  and motivational stuff which most are good to be fair and i was kinda moved. I lost a lot of my savings and I was in debt on the process but i did not stop there, I continue to do so in a number of these get rich quick scheme which are, I think its safe to say on its golden age in those period. I continue to fail and fail miserably I did. I finally called it quits. I just went back to what I do good and make a living out of it. Looking back, I could still say that my experience with those gave me a wiser recognition in detecting BS in almost all things that I also applied in my present work. I love everything you do. This is exactly what I wanted to do or expose way back many years but doesn't have the talent or the guts to do so. I am so thankful that somebody else did it for me.

In our continent, ancestors survived on hunting and farming...later white man work started to spread... centuries later, people began to survive on people. -work for me, i will pay you this - in this pyramid, many lost faith because of unfairness structures thus the trigger of such videos. 
james jani in summary says- open up a YouTube channel-.  well this is not a message. hear me out.

the world is is rapidly becoming ours for the take. you could literally become anything you want. Old days are now the new settings. just like our ancestors, we now have hunt for our selves... and the best hunter kills the biggest beast.

this episode thumbnail is: there is no guide to richness.
just like in hunting, you can't be sure of what to come.
master your skills for the best.

As I learned alot by taking one of such course
Actually when we take course we should know what a person is doing for him self 
If he make fake promises he is fake
Person should have product or business or services from which he is earning and his experience is teaching him which he is sharing with others
Fake gurus they themselves never done any business and they teach how to do business
I learned 7 yrs back with our person who was simple
To the point 
And taught business growing tips from his business background 
Which worked really well
And I gained progress in my business.

So whenever u select learning see to whom u r learning.they should have something to teach

Like you say you tend to find these creatures (or they find you) when you are at your lowest and most desperate for cash. I didn't know much about MLM at the time, but that is what they were pushing. Using fake charm, and sloppy white marker board presentation delivery and rapid fire verbal delivery of financial bullshit. Came across to me as very unprofessional - but then I come from a formal teaching background. But the worst thing was they had human plants around the room who would approach you suddenly and act pseudo friendly (with that cult smile on the face) and try to extract personal info out of you with a view to on the spot recruitment. Being naturally suspicious and not desperate to become part of any group in any case, I gave false info and slipped out of there. All I can say is that these people are predators.

just remember, if you could get rich overnight, everyone would be doing it, and the guru would be exploiting it rather than telling everyone else.",2022-06-21T04:52:24Z
DDynamite is awesome,"James I really agree with your narrative, I've gone down the same path before.

My maine gripe with this video is that the main example u gave (Vemma) does not align with your main point (about Gurus that make their money from teaching and not doing what they teach). 

Yes, both can be get-rich-quick schemes that we should avoid, but MLMs and pyramid schemes are a completely different problem. 
MLMs have unfair incentive structures that heavily benefit the founders and early members, while the new members have to essentially establish the same hierachy below them, that the people above have just to enjoy the rewards that the people above enjoy ( which in turn benefits those at the top).

Course Gurus either sell courses because they cant get the results they want from doing what they teach, or cannot scale their own business past a certain point (i.e. service based agencies)

Its not perverse incentives if its the latter, where the gurus have seen success and results before, although at a small-medium scale. Case in point, a lot of service based businesses (whether they sell courses or not) struggle to scale past 8 figures bc its a people based industry and its difficult to scale the founder's formula past the first few teams that the founder can directly teach.

The next question then is should we be paying thousands of dollars for these courses that are taught by successful business owners? Some might argue so, since its very possible that these business owners have that secret sauce that is marginally superior to everyone else in the industry, giving them the upperhand, thus qualifying them to be Gurus and justifying their pricey courses. 

My advice is this, especially for those WHO ARE STARTING OUT: That extra 
""special"" knowledge that Gurus charge for is unnecessary if you're just starting out, and you would be better served by similar courses on platforms like Udemy. Seriously, whatever Guru's course u are considering, theres probably a similar one on Udemy for a hundred quid, taught by a similarly qualified instructor with relevant experience. If somehow that Guru's course has some special sauce that would give u a marginal edge over the competition, I'm sure you will figure it out with experience and trial and error in that business/ industry. My point is that u can get your business started with a 10-100 times lower  (learning) cost.

Also, when u setup a new account on Udemy, u can get most courses FOR A FLAT FIXED OF UNDER $20 BUCKS. Just decide the course slowly and start a new account when you are ready to purchase. 

Thats all u need to start any business from whichever Guru's course for $20 :)",2022-06-21T03:48:48Z

I eventually went into telecom sales, then ran a few businesses, which didn't do very well.  The first 15 years of my career can be summarized as long hours and low pay.  I eventually got hired by a Fortune 500 company and quickly rose thru the ranks.  I have done very well the last 12 years and have earned enough for a nice retirement.  What i have learned from my experiences is the money and title of my position is not the reward.  When I look back I realize how much I learned grinding it out, and how it helped me improve my character which is priceless.  During those first 15 years of my career I learned patience, work ethic, made great relationships with customers and coworkers and many other things.   If you were lucky enough to strike it rich quickly you miss out on great character development.  Think of famous actors, musicians, people who inherit their wealth, and all the trouble that follows.

Understand the world of real estate and how to play the game. So on and so forth. I clicked his video cuz it was on his thumbnail and I was disappointed he didn‚Äôt bring him up all that much.

He couldn't convince one town to seize the houses of little old ladies who were broke.  And some of the property that he bought were tiny strips of land (like a ten foot strip along a right of way that ran a hundred yards) that only the abutters might be interested in for a couple of hundred dollars.  He lost everything and then went to the Town Hall and killed people before he killed himself.  He didn't even realize that it was the TV huckster that had tricked him.

JB,"""No matter how educated, how smart, or how self aware you are‚Äî you can fall for this too.""

No. No you cannot. Self aware, intelligent people do not even bother with too-good-to-be-true schemes. They are resourceful enough to not rely on things like acting or making money online. Instead, they use their own personal intelligence to do what needs to be done to establish themselves first, then when they've created a comfortable life, that's when they diversify their income potential. But they usually stick with traditional business practices and never waste their hard earned money on a monetary gambling scheme.

It's like cults.
When they say that anyone can be susceptible to get sucked into a cult...No, no, no. Rational and mentally sound people who are stable will never waste their time and energy by devoting it to something that isn't even realistic. Its just not possible to talk a stable and healthy person into shit like that. If you disagree, then you're obviously trying to think emotionally about it and using some example of a person you think you knew and how they got GOT. You didn't know that person, because they obviously weren't healthy and mentally stable when you weren't there. 

I dont know why sympathy is even brought up when describing the consequences of joining a scam or a cult. You should have known better. End of story.",2022-03-23T03:05:09Z

Giorgos KOUSOULOS Kousoulos,"One year ago, I was broke, jobless and I was living on by begging for coins outside churches. Today I am earning 2.000-3.000 dollars per month. In a few months I got a new car , brand new cloths, new appliances and here is how I did it. It is very easy.

Working 12-14 hours a day. That's it. Firstly I found a part time job to stay float. Then I found a full time job and worked by way to the top by working hard. I got promotions to both works. Then I learned how to create wooden flower pots by wooden pallets. I watched youtube videos, saved money to buy the needed equipment and started selling them. The wooden pallets are cheap to buy and they give you a good profit.

That's it. This is the easy way to make money. Learn a craft, get two jobs and work your a** off. It is easy because it is only 3 steps, but it is hard. Sometimes it will burns you out BUT when the end of the month comes and you get your 2.000-3.000 bucks you can get a weekend on a 4 star hotel to gain your strength back. 

There is no other way to gain easy money.",2022-03-20T05:27:20Z

Jeremy Wayne,"I was in Vemma back in 2015 and actually met people like BK Boreyko, Alex Morton, Vincent Ortega Jr., Eric Worre, and others in Phoenix. I have videos about that on my channel. It was all very exciting at the time. I was gonna be somebody! I was gonna travel, buy houses, and prove my friends and family wrong! While I ultimately did not get rich, I did learn a few things about myself: I was insecure, gullible, and desperate.

I really like this video and your MLM video because they echo a lot of my own experiences throughout my journey in internet marketing. I bought into the whole idea of getting rich from network marketing first back in 2009/2010. It really is like a vortex of delusions that sucks you into a world of endless possibilities... and when I say endless, I also mean bad things, like debt, broken friendships, and low self-esteem. I am now an open advocate against network marketing, even though I still know many people who do them. I fell very hard in 2016 for something that ended up hurting my family. I tried to speak out against it and was threatened with lawsuits. The skills I had acquired gave me some leverage to at least get my money back (well, the cost to join at least).

Was my foray in MLMs and network marketing a complete waste? No, not at all. I learned digital marketing skills that helped me land my current corporate role. I am also in the process of starting my own SEO/SEM agency to consult for small to medium-sized businesses. I count my website building, blogging, and page ranking as viable experience, because it did produce results, even if I didn't become a millionaire from selling healthy energy drinks. I didn't like the person I was while I was trying to sell a dream lifestyle, but I definitely love where I am now.",2022-03-15T20:40:57Z

One way or another YT is profiteering from scum bags and the victimisation of users.
There is no report ad option. If a producer like James contacts YT on the subject the result is a deafening silence. YT is like a mob godfather getting his cut from the lesser crooks doing the crimes and risking the time. The God father floats serenely above it all enjoying his ill gotten gains.

IKnowBetterThanYou,"Hey brother - when I was in mid-teens I was reading all sorts of real estate investment books. I also worked at multiple  inbound telemarketing companies, taking orders for different grq systems, diet packages, ""collectable"" coins, music collections... basically everything that had a infomercial or a commercial. The worst part was some companies would string on multiple upsells of sometimes completely unrelated products and services. One of the largest companies really had no qualms taking orders for absolutely anything with out any ethical or product quality concerns.

Around the same time, a classmate tried to recruit me into a nutritional supplement pyramid organization. I left my hourly job early, got dressed up in my best clothes and went to an office building where the organization had rented a small office, set up a cheap table and tablecloth, and had laid out bottles of ""health supplements"". Having been sucked into a pyramid scheme as an adolescent, it took only a few minutes into the presentation for me to realize what this was. As I got up to leave, my classmate pulled me to a chalk board and started drawing the pyramid network I could build. ""You know <mutual acquaintance 1> and <mutual acquaintance 2>. And the both know at least 2 people, right?"" oh boy.",2022-03-11T23:09:47Z

Stephen Cholette,"This will sound terrible, but I love these fake gurus. They keep people out of legitimate money-making operations because of their experience in the pyramid schemes, leaving them thinking a 9-5 is the only way to make money.  All the while I get to exist in these legitimate money-making areas without competition (for the most part). You can develop passive income, but no single passive income will be enoungh to survive on, you'll need dozens but that's okay, you only have to do something once. Dividends, proper investments, government bonds, ect. will make you money, just not a lot from one single source. Stack them up over a few years and you can make your monthly goal of passive income.",2022-03-06T11:55:44Z

Jason Hyland,"Hey man, just came across your channel and definitely really like what you got going on. However, on this video in particular, your thumbnail's a wee bit clickbait-ee, wouldn't you say? You only mention those pictured right out the gate when you searched ""How to make $ quick"". 

But more so why I felt like commenting is Cardone in particular is nothing like the type of people this video describes. He is someone on a whole different level of wealth that's been built over years and years of mastering his crafts. I agree w you on Lopez, don't know enough about Lok. But Cardone definitely isn't one of these snake oil guys whatsoever IMO. I have absolutely no affiliation with him at all, just my opinion based on lots and lots of reading and watching videos.

Tagasulat,Hi James! You are amazing! I've seen this video 2 months ago and have to check it now because I notice something in the comment sections of most of the YouTube Channels I'm watching related to crypto or investing like your channel (I see one from this video) or Alux. There are always a couple of comment thread that talk about someone being good at Crypto or investing. saying their investment has been doubled after a few weeks or so. It looks like a normal conversation but when you clicked on the profile and view the person's other comments you will see that they are posting the same comments over and over to different videos. This is also true with most of the accounts that reply within the thread and most those accounts are all created within the same month. I know you did a video about those who pose as a certain channel by intentionally mispelling the names to scam people. This might be their new way of scamming people. I hope you read this.

Omar P,"I feel that Inbound Closer falls in the same category as the get rich quick schemes. Their spokesperson Peyton Welch makes ridiculous claims that you triple your earnings in 21 days and uses the trigger phrases/words.  All of his ads on Youtube follow the same formula. He complains about working at a retail store and puts a sob story and then says he used ""the method"". Boats, Lamborghinis in his ads typical. He never explains ""the method"" ever. He got lucky his brother is involved and carried him all the way. Its pretty much calling and closing deals and hope to make a commission and few actually succeed. The social proof he presents is fabricated and leaves a lot left to desire. The course it's self is way too overpriced for such basic information. $497 for the advanced course what a joke. Don't fall for these scams. The Inbound Closer people probably have bots accounts ready to attack accounts and channels who critique them. I'd laughed if they come and attack this account because I'm right. False or misleading marketing for sure. Thanks.",2021-08-14T14:50:17Z

nikushim666,"Always love when they counter its a pyramid with ""no, its a triangle"". Sooooo a pyramid in two dimensions. Sad part is some of these scammers play it coy, not flexing cash but rather pretend to be a expert in a profession. The big one right now is ""Stock trading"", vast majority of them demonstrating ""live"" trades are either using a Paper sim (IE a simulation using 20+ min old market data, with basically buy/sells being done with monopoly money) or they are having their cult followers pump and dump for them. First thing you really gotta ask your self when you see people selling courses/mememberships etc. Is if they are so successful doing it, why do they need to sell a course, and why would you invite more competition into your market?  In the US there is a loophole with Pyramid schemes that allows them to skirt the law. And that is at least 40% of the revenue has to come from the product. The way they get around this is having suckers who buy into the scheme to buy the product from them, and thus you have Countless MLM's all over the place.",2021-08-08T00:44:11Z

Youtube > sells ad space too companies to have ads on videos of people who youtube > ""recruits"" like you, then passively forces you to make engaging videos that work inline with its alogorithim, so you engage people to watch your videos and subsequent company placed ads, which increases and/or keeps the market share of companies who pay youtube which youtube then pays you a tiny little cut as long as you abide by youtubes rules. You then also think you're clever to promote other companies goods or services to profit from that aswell. which do people really need the snake oil you're promoting? and do they need the snake oil promoted in the ads you see on youtube? not really, but it's ""fill in the blank"" to have what companies say you need.

L R,"I‚Äôm going to explain why this video and videos like this will keep you poor forever.

Think of a time when you had a really good business idea, you thought about it over and over, analysed  all the possibilities, discussed the plan with friends to get their feedbacks and kept researching until eventually you conclude that the idea is not as good as you thought. 

That‚Äôs called a self critical loop and it‚Äôs the enemy of progress. Now imagine a time when you or someone you knew had a business plan threw caution to the wind and focused on the quickest and most effective way to get a plan implemented... maybe it didn‚Äôt work, maybe they lost money but they also probably did learn a lot faster with hands on experience than they would have using their intuition. Extraverted thinkers are at the top of most companies and they always ask, what‚Äôs the quickest and most effective way to get things done and they ask out loud, they look to experts and take information from different sources to build there own framework. 
They don‚Äôt spend too long slicing things down  in there head they learn on the job, they don‚Äôt dwell on loses or wins and they just keep going.. videos like this push two false and harmful narratives, 1) everyone that uses effective marketing techniques is a scam artist & 2) you should never take risks and always be cautious. This is Very harmful because it‚Äôs usually the ignorant but ambitious and willing to learn  people who succeed in life while the analytical ones who already know the answer just die as failures. I learned the hard way, I tried to talk my friend out of buying a ‚Äúget rich quick course‚Äù he didn‚Äôt listen and now he makes fairly decent money using what the course taught him(he does domain real estate) Could he have found the information for free? Probably, but would he have pursued it at all if it wasn‚Äôt for those YouTube ads? Probably not.",2021-07-31T23:02:06Z

Ravi Shankar Bhatt,"Sometimes especially when you are low, it is easy to fall for these con men. If you follow and watch closely in the way each one of them conducts, you see the pattern. I was also mesmerised by these con men but gut feel always told me that it is not as easy as they are making it and was able to steer clear of it. Also I had seen quite a few guys go bust doing MLM business/Pyramid schemes and going bust in my circle, it also felt a little cultist and fortunately I never had enough money to invest in their courses or businesses so I was safe. Then I discovered there were videos exposing their game plan and I thanked myself for not falling into their trap. Moreover you should also do value proposition  as to why would someone try so hard to sell you a secret for a p√®edly amount. Bill Gates may do charity never sell a couse to become next Microsoft. Also if you watch their life style you see they lay roo much focus on themselves and lavish spending and a real businessman is anything but a reckless spender, he/she will only spend if there is better cost benefit analysis. So beware of these snake oil salesman. Nice video",2021-07-31T05:45:23Z

2. Avoid debt whenever possible

4. Invest these savings into a reliable savings vehicle that at the very least maintains purchasing power over a long period of time (stocks, bonds, gold, etc)
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for several decades 
6. Hire a trustworthy and competent estate lawyer to create an iron-clad trust/will so that your life savings is put to good use after you die (charity, inheritance to descendants, etc.)

Starblaiz,"Can't help but point out the parallels with these Get Rich Quick ""gurus"" and how Donald Trump conned his followers into thinking an election was ""stolen"" from them. It's the same cult-like brainwashing that gets them to ignore facts and outside sources of information (""Mainstream media is all fake news! Only listen to me!""). It's no coincidence that Trump is invested in MLM's like Herbalife, and even had his own MLM (Trump University) which was shut down right after he became president. On Jan 6th he told his followers during the insurrection ""we love you"" and ""you are very special people"" - classic love bombing like in any MLM cult. It's a critical flaw in human psychology that we need to find a fix for, because it's a dangerous vulnerability.",2021-07-30T16:09:58Z

Working a 9-5 does not make you a failure especially if you enjoy your work and gives you a comfortable lifestyle.

The people who work 9-5 jobs are heroes, not the ""entrepreneurs"" that tell you to drop out school and open your business and become entrepreneurs. Money is just a piece of paper that can help you in life in some matters but in no way must be the focus of your life. Find your ideal and purpose in life even thought nothing matters at all but we as humans we are absurdists and we do things that have meanings for us. So before you waste your life chasing money, do something with purpose and enjoy your life because after all one day we will die and I know none of you wants to live a life where they chased a piece of paper to buy materialistic things which never truly made you happy. Don't let someone's opinion become your reality. Live your life as you want it and most importantly enjoy it. After all every human will work till they die, because work is what seperates us from the other creatures.",2021-07-30T14:16:56Z

They pretend that they just wanna talk about life and that stuff but it was just a set-up so that they can easily hook their prospect into their business. Most of the time, it's their people within their social circle that they are preying with.",2021-07-30T13:20:46Z

I wss excited to put into practice what I'd learnt from Danlok. Then I started trying those same pitches and they were not working out at all. They were so unpractical.

I am also learning editing and acting and speech. I have a lot of knowledge in the building and renovating sector. So I started a Youtube channel, just like you did. Today I am making about 70‚Ç¨ per month, so slowly and steadily trying to turn my hobby and passion into full-time work. Right now I am writing the script for my new channel trailer and I have learned some small editing ideas from your videos. You have a nice style. I mean, you can speak about one sentence for around 2 minutes, and still, everyone is listening. 

Anyway, my dream job is, that I can build myself home and by filming that, make some income. Kinda like informative building vlogs is something I plan to start after few years. Today I share my knowledge and learn to make watchable videos. First time in front of the camera I almost shitted my pants :D. Today I have more confidence, but still have a long way to go.

Etsy and eBay are overflowing with them. I usually shop on Etsy because I want to support an independent artist who makes everything themselves. And I try to use eBay as an alternative to Amazon because a lot of small mom & pop stores use eBay as a selling platform. Nowadays it's almost impossible to tell who is a small business or independent artist and who is just some random bro who set up a drop ship account, and if I purchase something from them I'll end up getting an item from Alibaba, Wal-Mart, or Amazon, the very places I was trying to avoid.",2021-07-30T10:58:02Z

Lawrence Akainyah-Jectey,"I remember how I fell for the Max International scheme during my second year at the university. 
A friend introduced me to it...but it wasn't until after my second month in it that I started noticing the trends. They never really marketed their products. I started spending more money than I had, even in that short period.
But what really took me out of it was the dubious ways in which they sold their supplements to people with serious health conditions who were desperate to find solutions. My background in biological sciences became a catalyst for my exodus. 

Thank you very much for this video James.

Them: ""No, of course not! That would be a scam wouldn't it? No no, you make the whole $10 minus the $5 *under breath* and the $3 you spent on X.
Also you can buy 500 packets of X for just $500, so that way they're only $1. But in order for us to let you buy 500 at once, we need a $1000 refundable non-refundable payment.""
Target: ""OK when would I get my refund on that?""
Them: ""Non-refundable if you ask for the refund or if you sell all 500 units. Also there is Gold tier which means units are free plus $2.95 postage even though you're picking them up yourself in minimum orders of 1500. You get to Gold tier by selling 803 units in your first two months, and if you sell 802 units there is a ""success fee"" of $1400 but you'll have made so much money it won't matter.""

Javi Inkling,"Every time I hear the phrase ""passive income"" I can tell from a mile away that it's a whole load of bullshit, whether it's real estate, dropoff shipping, sales, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc, you'll need to do your own research and become an expert of what you're doing as well as starting with investments you can afford with money you're willing to potentially lose if things go wrong so you can earn it back. But if you really want to earn a lot of money doing all of that you'll need to get a job or start your own business so you'll get a stable income where you'll get the money to invest as well as using some of that active income to cover your living expenses.

But if you really want to make a change in your economic situation you'll need to cast away the consumer within you, which ironically for these fake gurus that promise you wealth is what they're targetting, why else would they dangle the luxurious life like candy? They know you want all of that, the cars, the phone, the clothes, the jet flights, the penthouse, you name it. They want you to think you'll be rich by being a mindless consumer who doesn't work nor put any effort and form their own experience, which will only cause you to live in debt and live a lifestyle you can't afford while you're under their spell (cue the instagram posts promoting the scam). Once you stop chasing luxury and realize that wealth is not something to show off by the products you use, is when you'll realize that those ""rich"" entrepreneurs that try to sell you their ""fantastic"" course are not only way less wealthy than they want you to think but also profiting off of your naivety to keep their fake lifestyle so they can keep fooling you, they're truly the nastiest type of parasite.",2021-07-29T21:09:47Z

Many years ago we had a vemma guy in church.  He made such a fool of himself hocking that crap in church, and it was not his first pyramid scheme.  The last I saw him, he was still working at the same gas station.  The vast majority of wealthy people get there slowly.  Get out of debt, stay out of debt, make regular legitimate investments instead of payments, and you really can do it.",2021-07-29T20:30:28Z

Watched a movie alone in a nearby theater, thought about it, thought about it, then I blocked her from all social media and told her the next day I'm out.

Micic Uros,"Really incredible topic. I personally am in the middle of the ""get rich quick"" scheme, there is an echo chamber, and many of the red flags you spoke about. But... The hook is there, I am invested, I used to beat myself up pretty bad before but now I feel good. The course I am selling is good value and worth the money respectively, there is the shame element in it but I am personally out of it. It is only new people that are getting in who get into the scheme and I also have the possibility to change the scheme for the people I sell to. I am very passionate about the topic, I am learning a lot, I am developing myself and putting myself out there, developing sales skills. I don't see this as a path to the rainbow but just a stepping stone to a new ground. Many of the people who are in it say that the course and service itself is worth the money even if people don't make a sale. So technically I don't have the guilt BUT... I also know that many people from my fellow colleagues will not have it good, they will feel robbed they will not be served the way they may have been promised but that's out of my hands. For the things inside of my hands, things are great except for the fact that I didn't made a sale yet... the whole thing is screaming irony but what you gonna do :/",2021-07-29T20:01:11Z

the name had been rebranded to Quixtar... We made a big total of 2k and it was from some sales, not even the recruiting and consuming process!

Alvin Jackson,"I have to say this because it needs to be said (knowing I love James' videos)...Getting rich ""fast"" is what everyone should expect in today's world, especially running an online business. The idea of ""get-rich-quick"" was a shady proposition when factory work and the industrial complex dependent on labor was a THING. This is no longer the case, thus, getting rich quick is feasible! James' own channel is proof of this!

Now don't get me wrong, the scumbags portrayed in this video are NOT who those who want more out of life should follow. I agree. However, the methods of making money fast are out there from reputable teachers and has personally worked for me. 

Amazon Book: Written and published in 30 days. 30 days later, I had my first $68.90 check and it grows every month. 
Online Course: $3,900 in 3 days from a promotion to my email list and grows every month. 
Affiliate For Course-Related products: $250-$1,500/month from email list and Youtube channel (I built the channel over the last 2 years). 

This was from one 6 month productive period, and I'll be paid for years to come. Is that fast enough? The mindset has to change about ""get-rich-quick"". It's antiquated and untrue for our time.",2021-07-29T19:48:35Z

That's where I learned how the real estate concept and math works in a simple way. Though he deleted some of those videos. You gotta listen and do it yourself n that takes a lot of work, do it anyway. Ain't no such thing as get rich quick.

So I dove head first into the ""how to make money online world"". I spent almost an entire year listening to bullshit from people like Dan Lok, Dan Pena, etc. Fortunately, like I already said, I was broke so I only spent like maybe $30 altogether on those online courses, but the effect it had on me, man... I was literally seeing all these numbers pop on my screen: $10k / month, $30k / month, $50k / month and it just had such a terrible effect on me. It literally made me feel so bad about myself for not achieving those numbers. Took me some time to realize it's all a pile of bullshit and all that money they make is either not even profit, or it's their salary from simply selling their course...
