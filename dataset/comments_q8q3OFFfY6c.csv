Vivek Joshi,"Hi Darshil!
One small question. Sorry it's not related to DE but ETL.
Do I need know ETL for a data analyst jobs in India ?
I have looked Job desctiption of data analyst jobs in India and the US & I saw this pattern of ""requiring knowledge of ETL & Data Warehouse"" in most DA jobs in India where as DA jobs in the US have least number of requirements.

I don't know what is the ground reality of Data Analyst jobs in India but things like those make me scare away from applying to DA jobs in the country until I get ETL knowledge(my brain tells me that). Now I don't know heck about ETL because my professional Certification did not cover ETL so I am unable to freely apply for jobs and feel chained due to not knowing that one ETL technology.
Thank you if you could help.",2022-09-21T01:48:31Z

Darshil Parmar,"EDIT:
Elon Musk ruined the API part, I suggest you use a static dataset from Kaggle and then use Airflow to process it

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmmarchetti/tweets-dataset

FAQ:
1. Twitter removed free access: It still has free access but with limits of requests you can make - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api

2. You need to request for V2 access: You will get an error but just by reading the doc you should be able to access Elevated Access
