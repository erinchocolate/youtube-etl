Exegesis 66,"Excellent presentation. I found this out too. The key components here give you a higher quality result. I've found that breaking it down is helpful. I will ask if it understands or sometimes I will give it context, then an exemplar and ask it to respond ""read"" and only ""read"" so I don't use up memory. That allows me to load in content. I've found it does better with preloading it with context and exemplars then giving it a task after that.",2023-08-11T20:31:33Z

gabner,"The Ultimate Beginner‚Äôs Guide to ChatGPT Prompts!

1. Task
Always start the task sentence with an action verb first. I.e generate, write, give, etc.

If it's a multitask request. Give an action verb at every different task.

2. Context
Hard to get right as there's a lot you could give GBT for context. However, focus on being specifics and limiting the possibilities

Ask
a) What's the users background 
b) What does success look like?
c) What environment are they in?

i.e I'm a 70 kg 5 '8 male [User Background] looking to put on 5kg of muscle mass over the next 3 months [Success]. I only have time to go to the gym twice a week and for 1 hour each session 

(Constrain the possibilities).

3. Exemplar 

I.e Prompt you could potentially give: Rewrite [whatever] using this structure ""I accomplished X by the measure of Y that resulted in Z,  _like for example_ I lowered hospital mortality rates by 10% through educating nurses in new protocols which translates to 200 lives saved per year""

You could also literally copy and paste a exemplar off of the internet and ask ChatGPT to do something similar. Give it some context i.e ""[ChatGPT] your a hiring manager at netflix... Draft the job description using this existing job description below: [Copy and paste]"".

4. Persona
Who do you want the AI to be? (i.e your professor who has been teaching for over 20+ years now)

5. Format
Ask yourself how exactly do you want the end result to look like?

I.e I just received a lengthy industry report for my director first give me the three key takeaways then summarize based on topic _use H2 as section headers_ here is the report [copy and paste the report]

Pro tip: When asking ChatGPT to proofread: Make sure you tell it to bold all changes made.
 
6. Tone
i.e ""use a formal tone of voice""

If you can't think of a good tone. Tell ChatGPT how you want to sound then use the word it prescribes. 

I.e I'm writing an email and I want to be taken seriously without coming off as too stuck up and cringey. Can you please give me a list of 5 tone keywords I can include in a prompt for ChatGPT.

Then during your prompt says something like ""Use [the tone ChatGPT suggested] tone of voice]""

(in order of importance, Highest to Lowest, not necessarily the order at which they have to be inserted)

Good Example of all them together

""You are a senior product marketing manager at Apple (Persona) and you have just unveiled the latest Apple product in collaboration with Tesla the Apple car and received 12 000 pre-orders which is 200% higher than Target (Context). Write an email to your boss Tim Cookie sharing this positive news (Task and Format). The email should include a tl;dr too long didn't read section, project background section explaining why this product came into existence, business results section in quantifiable business metrics, and end with a section thanking the product and Engineering teams (Example)

Use clear and concise language and write in a confident yet friendly tone (Tone)""",2023-08-07T20:03:10Z

The options are endless, which I absolutely love. Thank you! Also, I noticed that the examples (black screen with moving white dots and then the copy over it) are on the screen longer. Thank you!! Not sure why but it helps me take in and absorb the info easier. Love it!!",2023-08-05T13:03:56Z

personaldev,"Chatgpt : As an AI language model, my knowledge is based on the data available up to September 2021. I do not have access to real-time information or data beyond that date. Therefore, any information or events that occurred after September 2021 are beyond my knowledge scope. If you have any questions or need information beyond that date, it's best to refer to reliable and up-to-date sources of information.

Parker Sheldon,"Jeff, you are the best! Your vids are always so on point and useful. 

Question; what ""shortcut"" have you found to be the best way to quickly ""access"" chatGPT that include a default template with the prompts you've mentioned here. I use alfred, and set up a quick workflow to add a string to the S-GPT apple shortcut. I am not sure exactly how to add the ""prompt"" as a template to the workflow. Not enough time for a deep research dive to figure it out. Overall, this has worked fine, but I am curious if you have found any other workflows that are efficient?

For those who reads this and uses obsidian, I also open ChatGPT with custom frames plugin while working in there. Super handy!
